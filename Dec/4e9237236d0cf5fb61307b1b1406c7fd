A patient at the Kakamega County Referral Hospital committed suicide yesterday.Josphat Konga, who was suffering from severe ulcers, was discharged from hospital on Sunday evening and was waiting to go home yesterday.But his condition worsened and he hanged himself in the bathroom using his wife&#39;s wrap-around garment. Attempts to reach his wife and relatives at the hospital were futile as security guards denied journalists access to the facility. Police are still investigating the matter. Kakamega County Police Commander Tito Kilonzi said&nbsp;Konga&#39;s wife alerted the nurse in charge after her husband stayed for too long in the bathroom.&quot;He was suffering from acute ulcers. He left for the bathroom at 3am but overstayed there which worried his wife. He was found hanging in the bathroom,&quot; said Mr Kilonzi.For other patients at the hospital it was pain and hopelessness as doctors and nurses made good their strike threat.Patients were turned away to seek medicare in private hospitals. Patients in the wards were advised to seek medication in private hospitals.Janepher Lukalia was admitted to the Kakamega County Referral Hospital on Friday, but yesterday she was told to seek treatment at a private facility.&quot;I am feeling pain, I have been told to seek medical services from a private hospital but I do not have money. I am going home hoping for a miracle from God,&quot; she said.Ms Lukalia was among many patients who left the wards without knowing their fate as medics insisted the strike will end only if their grievances are addressed. Kenya National Union of Nurses&nbsp;Kakamega&nbsp;Secretary General Renson Bulunya said they were on early Christmas holiday.
