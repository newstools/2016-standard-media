They confirmed performing the caesarian section on Aoko&rsquo;s dead body to remove the child,&rdquo; said Achieng.She was just fine when we got to the hospital because she is the one who gave the details for registration,&rdquo; she explained.The family said the bodies had been brought to the local Matangwe morgue in Bondo where they had appealed to the hospital officials to refer the bodies.They accused the clinical officer who had performed the C-section of disappearing after the death of Aoko instead of facing the family with the truth.MATERNAL AUDIT ALSO READ: Mourning family blames striking doctors and State for son's deathThe family also accused the clinical officer of using an overdose of&nbsp;&nbsp; anesthesia and keeping the body from the family for several hours.According to county Health Executive Olang&rsquo;o Onudi, the county government will conduct a maternal audit before the weekend to determine whether the death of Aoko was due to negligence or unavoidable circumstances.Dr Onudi maintained that the clinical officer who carried out the operation was trained and authorised to carry out the procedure and had done it successfully in the past.&ldquo;The clinical officers were trained in 2007 in reproductive health and those are special clinical officers allowed by the Government to carry out caesarean section,&rdquo; he said.But a medical doctor from Siaya who sought anonymity told to The Standard that the clinical officer should have referred the patient to a private facility for more accurate and proper procedures.&ldquo;With the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike, it is not advisable for clinical officers to perform such sensitive procedures especially with lack of enough experience. He should have referred the patient,&rdquo; added the doctor.The death occurred only a day after a consultant surgeon, Dr James Obondi, warned that the ongoing crisis in public hospitals could spiral out of control as nurses and clinical officers on duty may be forced to handle ailments beyond their professional capability, resulting in medical disasters.
