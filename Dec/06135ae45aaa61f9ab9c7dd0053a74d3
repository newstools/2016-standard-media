The friend, Choi Soon-sil, 60, who had not appeared in public since arriving at a prosecutors&#39; office on Oct. 31, was led into court by two correctional officers, her head down, wearing a bulky grey prison suit with a number on her chest.She is charged with pressuring big businesses to pay money to foundations that backed Park&#39;s policy initiatives.Prosecutors have named Park as an accomplice, although she has immunity from prosecution while in office.

Her lawyer argued that Choi did not collude with Park or other defendants in the case, and also denied the fraud charge.&quot;I need to clarify the facts now,&quot; Choi was quoted as telling the court by Yonhap News Agency.Choi spoke so softly and she was barely audible in her brief comments.South Koreans have been keen to get a glimpse of the woman at the center of the political storm and members of the public were allocated seats in the court&#39;s gallery by lottery.&quot;I hope this becomes a turning point for change for the better for our society,&quot; said Lim Soon-ja, 68, one of those who attended.Two former presidential aides who have been indicted along with Choi did not attend the hearing, but their lawyers told the court that they had been following Park&#39;s orders.

South Korean courts normally hold criminal trials presided over by a panel of judges, who deliver a verdict and sentence, while defendants in select cases are given the choice of a jury trial.Her lead lawyer, Lee Kyung-jae, rejected the charge that Choi colluded with Park and one of the former aides to the president, An Chong-bum, to exert pressure on various &quot;chaebol&quot; conglomerates.&quot;We stressed that there was no collusion between Choi and An Chong-bum and the president, and we look forward to having an intense examination over this point,&quot; Lee told reporters after the hearing.The next hearing is set for Dec. 29.&nbsp;MASTERMIND?Earlier, a long queue of people who had won places in the gallery waited for nearly an hour to be allowed into the court.

Her father was shot dead five years later by his disgruntled spy chief.Choi is the daughter of a religious figure named Choi Tae-min, who was referred to in a U.S. diplomatic cable as the &quot;Korean Rasputin&quot; for his perceived influence over Park.
