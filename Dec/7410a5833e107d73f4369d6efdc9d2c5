The West African regional bloc said on Saturday it would take all necessary actions to uphold the result of a Dec. 1 election in Gambia, where veteran President Yahya Jammeh says he will not step down after losing to Adama Barrow.ECOWAS leaders said in a communique marking the end of a summit in the Nigerian capital that they would attend the Jan. 18 inauguration of Barrow, &quot;who must be sworn in&quot;, and guarantee the safety of the president-elect. Barrow&#39;s surprise victory and Jammeh&#39;s initial decision to step down was seen across Africa as a moment of hope.Jammeh announced on Dec. 9 that he would reverse that position and called for a fresh vote.
