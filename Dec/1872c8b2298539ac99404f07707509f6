Deputy President William Ruto has accused the Opposition of intimidating the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).Mr Ruto asked Opposition leaders to give the electoral body space to prepare for the 2017 General Election. He said the Opposition was better off seeking the support of Kenyans rather than engaging the electoral body in meaningless political theatrics.&quot;We must be very clear as leaders that elections are not about the leaders. Elections are about every Kenyan in Kenya today because it is their constitutional right to decide the leadership of the country,&quot; he said.&quot;We must allow Kenyans to make that decision in peace without threats, intimidation and blackmail,&quot; he added.
