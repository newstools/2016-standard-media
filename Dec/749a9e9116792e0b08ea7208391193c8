Mbeere South residents Thursday barricaded the Gachoka-Gachuriri road protesting against the adjudication and demarcation of the 17,000ha Mwea scheme land. They complained of being overlooked during the allocation of the land despite living there (in Makima ward) for decades. They vowed to resist any attempts to evict them from land they consider as lawfully theirs. The over 500 residents said the allocation of title deeds was illegal and unconstitutional as it was marred by nepotism, corruption and favouritism. They claimed there was complete disregard of the rights and interests of the residents of the scheme. &quot;I was born here and have lived all my life on this land. My grandparents lived, died and were buried in the same land. We were not informed that the land was being subdivided. We are Kenyans and have rights just like those who have been given land. We will not leave it since we have nowhere else to go,&quot; said Ruth Murage. Anti-riot police in full gear watched the demonstrators from a distance as they tried to remove a tree felled by the residents at Thiba Bridge to unblock the road. They at one time threw tear-gas canisters at the demonstrators to disperse them. READ: We have no right to point fingers on graft, says Kepsa Residents held similar demonstrations near Makima market and called on the national government to stop the subdivision. They want the process started afresh and to embrace full public participation with people residing on the land given priority on its allocation. On Monday, area MP Mutava Musyimi said he would petition the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the matter. He said out of the 12,000 families that reside in the settlement scheme, only 441 have benefited from the 7,200 titles.
