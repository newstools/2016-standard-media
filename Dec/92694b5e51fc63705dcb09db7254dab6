Public anger continued to mount in Kitui town Saturday, a day after former mayor Martha Mwangangi was crushed to death by a county government fire engine during protests. Outraged leaders criticised Governor Julius Malombe&rsquo;s administration and urged the National Government to inquire into the matter to establish the cause and nature of the horrific killing. In a joint press statement, Kitui Senator David Musila and former Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu said those responsible for Ms Mwangangi&rsquo;s death should be punished in accordance with the law and her family adequately compensated. &ldquo;We call upon the people of Kitui town (and the county) to remain calm as the National Government investigates this killing. First, we take this opportunity to send our heartfelt condolences to the children and family of the late former mayor,&rdquo; the statement said. They condemned the &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; destruction and demolishing of Kitui town&rsquo;s small-scale traders&rsquo; kiosks and goods worth millions of shillings by Dr Malombe&rsquo;s administration.

This wanton destruction of property by Malombe has left our small-scale traders economically disempowered a few days to the opening of schools, yet they need to raise fees for their children,&rdquo; the statement said. The two leaders said Mwangangi&rsquo;a killing cannot be justified under any circumstances.
