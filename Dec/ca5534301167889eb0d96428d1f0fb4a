Logistics firm, Siginon, is confident the completion of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) will not affect its business.Group Managing Director Meshack Kipturgo said the growing demand for logistics services should be enough to serve both the SGR and other firms in the market. &quot;I do not see SGR as a threat because demand is there. The economy is growing in the region and for that reason, there is demand in our industry,&quot; he said at a press briefing in Nairobi yesterday. Mr Kipturgo said the firm may tap into SGR - whose launch was scheduled for July next year - although it has emerged the new railway line may not be up and running until January 2018 due to financing constraints.&quot;We move cargo by air, road, sea and rail. There is the Rift Valley Railways today so in the same way, SGR is another mode of transport with a lot of opportunities for expansion. We will move our cargo by rail if the price is right,&quot; he said.The MD also announced the company will next year move its offices from Mombasa to Nairobi.
