UAP Old Mutual Group is expecting rekindled interest in home insurance covers ahead of the Christmas season from homeowners who are preventing a holiday disaster.UAP Old Mutual General Insurance managing director James Wambugu said homeowners normally take covers around the festive season to protect their homes from losses associated with burglaries, burst piping and overflowing water, amongst other perils.&quot;Most people go on holiday around this period, leaving their houses empty, which increases the likelihood of burglaries,&quot; said Wambugu. &nbsp;
