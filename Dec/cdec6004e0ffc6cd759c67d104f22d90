President Uhuru Kenyatta urged the Kamba community to shun tribal politics and instead support Jubilee in 2017.Uhuru said there was nothing wrong with the community shifting its political allegiance to Jubilee because his government was committed to developing all areas irrespective of voting pattern.The President told the community to ignore falsehoods and propaganda peddled by the Opposition against his government. &ldquo;I urge the Opposition to be honest in their criticism of the Government and critique my government&rsquo;s achievements instead of malicious lies,&rdquo; Uhuru said.The President spoke when he launched the tarmacking of the Kibwezi-Mutomo-Kitui-Kabati-Migwani road in Mutomo town, Kitui South Constituency.He said his administration had undertaken projects with far-reaching impacts in water, health, lands adjudication, energy, electricity connection and road works.All Kenyans equal&ldquo;My administration is serving all Kenyans equally irrespective of their political affiliations. Some of the developments in the political and public sphere were occasioned by independent institutions,&rdquo; he said.Uhuru said the notion that the Government was discriminating against some communities in development should be done away with.He said; &ldquo;We will not discriminate against any community on the basis of religion, region, political or ethnic backgrounds. All Kenyans are equal and will be served by the Government equally.&rdquo; He cited the construction roads under the annuity programme, generation of electricity, improvement of health facilities and rural electrification among other projects.Uhuru said the Jubilee administration was firmly in charge of the country, and was committed to implementing the pledges it made to Kenyans during the last elections.He urged Kamba leaders to put aside their political differences for the sake of development.Deputy President William Ruto said the Government has set aside Sh1.4 billion for land compensation to create space for the construction of Thwake dam in Makueni County, which will serve three counties.The DP said the Government had also set aside funds to complete the stalled Umaa dam in Kitui town which stalled in controversial claims of corruption for many years.Conflicting parties&nbsp;Ruto said that arbitration between conflicting parties had been resolved and works at the dam would commence in the next financial year.Kitui South MP Rachael Nyamai said she will rally her constituents to work closely with the Government in ensuring challenges facing the people were solved.Kitui Deputy Governor Peninah Malonza and Senator David Musila asked the President to fast-track exploitation of the vast mineral deposits in Ukambani.Other leaders present included governors Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni), nominated senator Beatrice Elachi, MPs Francis Nyenze, Bernard Kitungi, Marcus Muluvi, Charles Nyamai, Joe Mutambu, John Munuve, Victor Munyaka, Francis Mwangangi, Richard Makenga and Regina Ndambuki.
