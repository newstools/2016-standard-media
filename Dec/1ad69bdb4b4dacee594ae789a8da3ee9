When Ibrahim Madjid, Silvanus Ayiecha and Moses Kamau met five years ago in Umoja estate, they were all fresh out of high school.Lack of fees to continue with their studies and a collective passion for entertainment saw the three join hands and venture into clown business.&ldquo;We did not have capital when we started and could therefore not afford the requisite attires. We settled for wearing rags which made it difficult for us to fit into the market,&rdquo; says Ibrahim who is the group leader. What started as something they did within the estate has since grown and the trio now find themselves being invited for various events such as parties, road shows and even funerals.They have been able to travel to different counties where they perform and entertain people with their funny antics.They are now looking to recruit more young people and encourage them to capitalise on their passions and avoid waiting for the employment myth.&ldquo;Our main aim is to make this group grow. We also want to use it to empower other youth because we know the dangers of not being engaged in something constructive after school. One can easily become a target for drug and substance abuse,&rdquo; Silvanus said.The trio say they do what they do because it is something they enjoy immensely. In performing their antics, they get to entertain themselves even as they entertain others.While earning a living from a clown is not easy in Kenya, these three young men have been able to make their ends meet from this single venture.
