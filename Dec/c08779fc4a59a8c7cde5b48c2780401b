Wiper leader&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;Musyoka has been&nbsp;told&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;off Mwea Scheme land issues. Senator Lenny Kivuti said the people of Embu should be left to handle the matter on their own. The senator&nbsp;told&nbsp;Mr Musyoka to abandon plans to visit the 17,000ha scheme as his tour could incite the locals to violence. The affected people have been protesting against not being allocated land in the scheme. Last week,&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;alleged that the Government was in plans to dispossess scheme residents of their land.

Some of the residents have been living in the scheme for over 35 years. He claimed that outsiders were being issued with title deeds for over 83 per cent of the land at the expense of locals. The senator also took issue with a section of residents of Makima ward who tried to demolish Thiba bridge during a protest last week against the manner in which the land was being allocated. Kivuti said hooliganism will not help them since the process of adjudicating and demarcating the land was legal. &quot;I investigated the process following complaints by residents and found it was above board as the people were involved. Even Governor Martin Wambora can confirm that. Those complaining should know that not everyone could get the land,&quot; said Kivuti during the Jamhuri Day celebrations. Mr Wambora, however, did not delve into the issue only revealing that the county government had allocated 100 acres of the scheme to veterans of Mau Mau war. As the storm over the controversial land rages, Mbeere South MP Mutava Musyimi has said he will petition the corruption agency to investigate how the process was carried out.
