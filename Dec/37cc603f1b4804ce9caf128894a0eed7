President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday hailed Bomet County health workers for boycotting the nationwide medics&#39; strike. Speaking after launching Sh425 million equipment at Longisa County Referral Hospital in Bomet East, the President said Bomet doctors and nurses have set an example and asked other doctors to emulate them. &quot;Bomet doctors have set a good example in the country by being the only ones who have not boycotted duty to demand for money. Doctors in other counties should emulate this county,&quot; Uhuru said while addressing the public at Longisa market. The President was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso and local leaders. Uhuru, who was in the county to launch the medical equipment and upgrading of Daraja Sita-Labotiet-Chebunyo-Dikirr road, took a swipe at the striking health workers in the country saying they had abandoned Kenyans at their hour of need.

Before the President&#39;s visit, Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto said the talks with county health staff had borne fruit, noting the county will sign a CBA with the medics today. &quot;We have reached an agreement with our health staff and we will be entering into agreement with our health workers on Monday that will see them receive betters terms,&quot; said Governor Ruto. A source involved in the talks said the county had yielded to demands for salary increase for health workers and promotion of staff who have stagnated in their job groups for over five years. The President, at the same time, announced the Government would give Sh100 million towards upgrading of Koiwa Health Centre in Konoin and Kapkoros Health centre in Bomet East.
