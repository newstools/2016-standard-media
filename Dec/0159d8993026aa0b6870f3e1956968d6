At around 10.00 am, a Tuk-Tuk snakes its way towards the entrance of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) emergency section.It gets stuck on the gravelled stretch and comes to an abrupt stop.At the back, a patient grimaces in pain, jolted by the staccato thrusts of the three-wheeled ramshackle. At the entrance, the patient&#39;s attendants - a man and a woman who have been holding him between them - debate on how to get him out of the contraption.Their attempt to nudge him out elicits sharp cries of pain; another attempt to support him on his legs fails and the patient collapses in a helpless heap a few meters from the entrance.&quot;Let us hold his legs and hands,&quot; the woman whispersThey lift him up; the woman holding his hands, while the man holds his feet. Between them, they haul the patient into the casualty area like a sagging bag of potatoes.Their entrance barely disrupts the eerie silence inside Kenyatta National Hospital(KNH) since the doctors went on strike 16 days ago.No one seems to notice them. The few patients on the cold waiting benches stare blankly at the emptiness of the hospital hallways, looking lost and quietly wincing in pain.Inside the casualty rooms, armed policemen clutch their guns, keeping watch over rows empty beds.A doctor in military fatigues, and a white coat nonchalantly draped over his shoulder, walks around the deserted wards holding a stethoscope.He bends over to talk to a patient who is lying on the bench, then leaves almost immediately.He is one of the military doctors who were deployed to KNH by the Government when 290 consultant doctors from the University of Nairobi downed their tools.At the private doctors&#39; wing of the hospital, Maria Kerubo wanders around the corridors clutching a huge file that bears her three-year-old son&#39;s medical history. She came to inquire about his radio therapy sessions.&quot;Nobody is telling us anything, and our children are sick,&quot; she says, before sighing and slumping back on the waiting bench.Inside the Critical Care ward, a group of nurses attend to the patients hooked on life saving machines. A mother leans towards her child and rubs the back gently.The child lets out a slow painful groan, then drifts back to sleep.Her mother sits back, praying quietly that the doctor&#39;s strike will end by the time her child wakes up.
