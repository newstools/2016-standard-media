A construction company has denied demanding an extra Sh10 billion or extension of the time set for a pipeline project.Zakhem International Construction Ltd refuted claims by Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) that they sought to increase the project cost above the initial contract value of Sh48 billion. This emerged yesterday during the grilling of the company&rsquo;s leadership by Senate Energy committee chaired by Senator Gideon Moi (Baringo).The committee launched investigations to establish why Zakhem had allegedly asked for more money even after receiving Sh30 billion and doing 65 per cent of the work.Three companies sub-contracted by Zakhem to build the pipeline were hard pressed by the senators to explain their reasons for seeking more funds and time as disclosed by KPC Managing Director Joe Sang when he appeared before the committee over the matter.

The delays were occasioned by the unfavourable weather in Mombasa around that time,&rdquo; responded Quality Inspectors Ltd Managing Director Chege Kiragu.He added: &ldquo;We also had issues on our part with the new technology we had brought to use and the new equipment we had bought. This created a backlog, occasioning the delay.&rdquo;Mr Kiragu assured the senators that the companies had&nbsp; completed 80 per cent of the work assigned and had been paid 94 per cent of their invoices.Kiragu&rsquo;s company was sub-contracted to carry out Non-Destructed Testing (NDT) on the pipeline, which he acknowledged, is doing its work despite the delay.

Straccon Engineering and Dynamic Green Technologies also held the same position and they all promised to complete their work in the next two months.But the senators were not convinced, casting doubt on the true position of the project since both Zakhem and KPL appeared to be at loggerheads on the issue.Already, KPC has granted the contractor an extension of up to April 28, 2017, to enable them complete the remaining part of the 450km pipeline.Senator Moi summoned the contractor to shed light on the details of contracts entered between Zakhem and five sub-contractors after it emerged that KPC, which is overseeing the project, is in the dark as regards the terms of the mini-contracts.He expressed concern that this factor may have contributed to the slow pace of construction.
