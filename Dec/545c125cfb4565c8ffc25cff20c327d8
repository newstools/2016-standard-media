President Uhuru Kenyatta says roads authorities are to blame for accidents resulting from unmarked bumps on major highways in the country. Speaking during the 53rd Jamhuri Day celebrations at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi, the president urged Kenya National Highways Authority to admit blame for failure to erect clear sign posts on bumps along Kenyan roads. He also urged all road users to be more careful especially this festive season as most Kenyans travel upcountry for Christmas celebrations. The president&rsquo;s announcement comes one day after the Naivasha fire tragedy that claimed 39 lives in an accident along the Naivasha- Nairobi highway involving a canter lorry of Ugandan registration number and 13 other vehicles. The head of state at the same time called upon Kenyans to remain united and avoid divisive politics as the country prepares for next year&rsquo;s general election. He urged politicians to encourage unity and harmony during the campaign period and be ready to accept election results.
