Governor Julius Malombe has accused Senator David Musila and former Lands CS Charity Ngilu of organising mobs to cause violence against him. Dr Malombe said the politicians&rsquo; action was meant to hog publicity during the burial of former Mayor Mary Mwangangi on Friday.&ldquo;Musila and Ngilu must take full responsibility for the injuries inflicted on Bishop Anthony Muheria while presiding over the funeral mass for Mrs Mwangangi,&rdquo; said Malombe. The governor observed that he was condoling with Mrs Mwangangi son, Gideon, who is a county enforcement officer.&ldquo;Ngilu is no stranger to violence and chaos. Over her political career, she has stormed police stations twice and released suspects. Today, she incited people to violence and demonised a mourning family,&rdquo; he stated.Mrs Mwangangi was a celebrated Mayor of Kitui who served the county with distinction.
