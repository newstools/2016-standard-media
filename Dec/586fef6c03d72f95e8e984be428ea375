Kanu chairman Gideon Moi has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to write off huge debts owed by Rift Valley farmers.Speaking in Kabarnet, Baringo County, the Baringo senator said he was optimistic that President Kenyatta would extend a helping hand to other parts of the country, adding that most hardworking farmers had abandoned farming because of the heavy burden of repaying loans.&quot;I humbly asked the President to extend the waiver to other regions. What he did during his development tour in Central Kenya is commendable,&quot; he said. Addressing Kabarnet residents outside the Kanu offices, the senator denied claims that his political endeavours were aimed at dividing Rift Valley. The legislator, who was in the region to help raise funds for youth groups, said he had the interests of the Kalenjin community at heart and urged the electorate to shun divisive politics.&quot;Take it from me, I am not that leader who will drive his people to a political deathbed. But kindly register massively as voters,&quot; he added.Speaking at the same event, Kanu Secretary General Nick Salat criticised Deputy President William Ruto, accusing him of using dictatorial means to woo Rift Valley voters.Mr Salat asked residents to reject misleading voices, adding that some Jubilee leaders were spreading hate and political propaganda an effort to tarnish Gideon&#39;s name.Salat also said the Government should resolve the health crisis immediately to prevent further loss of lives.He also demanded an investigation into the police insurance scheme, saying too many issues had not come out clearly during the awarding of the scheme.&quot;This is more fraud. The directing of police officers to specific hospitals must be investigated. The owners of those health facilities must also be exposed,&quot; Salat said.Emurwo Dikir MP Johana Ngeno criticised Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and his Nandi counterpart Stephen Sang for claims they made against Gideon, saying the two had no moral authority to lecture the senator.Mr Ngeno asked Ruto to stop chest thumping and allow members of the Kalenjin community to freely chart their own political future.&quot;He should be informed that this country belongs to all Kenyans. Using force to have Kenyans accept his political wishes is wrong and should be rejected by the electorate,&quot; said Ngeno.But speaking from Kabarnet Boys High School, a few metres from the Kanu event, Mr Murkomen and Mr Sang urged Gideon to support Ruto and Jubilee Party in the August 8 elections.Mr Murkomen said it would be prudent for the Kanu chairman to support the DP as he was the presumed Kalenjin leader.
