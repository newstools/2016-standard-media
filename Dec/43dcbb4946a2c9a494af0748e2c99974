Counties want the national government to cut the Ministry of Health&#39;s budget because the health function is&nbsp;largely devolved.According to Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who chairs the Council of Governors&#39; (CoG) Finance Committee, the Government has retained most funds for healthcare.The Government allocated close to Sh60 billion to the Health ministry in the last two financial years and projects to spend a further Sh30 billion for the 2017-2018 financial year. According to the National Treasury recurrent expenditure, Government set aside Sh28.5 billion for the 2016-2017 financial year, down from Sh29 billion in the 2015-2016 financial year.In 2016-2017, Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) received Sh8.7 billion while Moi Referral and Teaching Hospital (MRTH) got Sh5.5 billion.&quot;Most of the money for human resources is still retained at the ministry yet we are the ones with many employees,&quot; Mr Oparanya said.Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye accused the national government of making it hard for counties to offer health services.According to Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo, the counties received Sh259.77 billion from the Government as equitable share of revenue raised nationally in the 2015-2016 financial year.The total amount of money given to counties to cater for health depends on each county&#39;s needs.Ms Odhiambo said Sh3.6 billion was given to the counties as conditional allocation for Level 5 hospitals.The information is contained in the County Governments Budget Implementation Review Report for the first half of the 2015-2016 financial year.The report also notes that counties are expected to receive Sh844.71 million from the Government of Denmark through the Danish International Development Agency as conditional allocation to the health sector, and Sh4.3 billion as conditional allocation for free maternal healthcare.The counties also received Sh4.5 billion as conditional allocation for leasing of medical equipment and Sh1.63 billion as conditional allocation for free maternal healthcare.CoG chairman Peter Munya said the National Treasury continued to allocate Sh150 billion more every financial year to the national government on budgetary items that were fully devolved.&quot;This forms the basis for the increased push for more allocations to counties,&quot; he said.
