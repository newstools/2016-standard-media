Nine bodies from the Naivasha road accident are yet to be identified.The Government yesterday also announced that 30 bodies have been correctly identified. They include those of two children who died at the scene and two others who passed on at Kenyatta National Hospital and Nairobi Hospital. The director of the National Disaster Operations Centre Nathan Kigotho&nbsp;said the identification of the nine had stalled as some families had not come forward to give DNA samples in order to match them.SEVERE BURNS&ldquo;Among the nine victims, some suffered severe burns while others were brought in as body parts and we are struggling to identify them. The nature of sample taking from some of the family members was also a challenge but we are working to identify them,&rdquo; said Mr Kigotho.

Bodies belonging to the GSU officers will, however, be collected from the Kenyatta University Funeral Home.Relatives will be required to present their identification cards, a letter from their local chief and a burial permit, which will be issued at the mortuary.&ldquo;The bodies are ready for release and we will be leaving the results of the DNA tests at the Chiromo mortuary for families to come, check and collect their loved ones,&rdquo; he added.The Government, he said, would be giving Sh50,000 to the families of the victims to help in burial arrangements. &ldquo;If the families need transport or even coffins, they will be provided by the mortuary but the cost will be deducted from the money given,&rdquo; he said.
