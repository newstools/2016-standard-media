President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto are in the North Rift to launch key road projects linking the Western circuit.This is Uhuru&#39;s first tour to the region since the formation of Jubilee Party, an outfit he and his deputy will use in seeking re-election. The President starts his tour in Nandi, his third visit since his election, before heading to the neighbouring Uasin Gishu County where he is expected to launch multi-billion shilling road construction projects.Uhuru who will be accompanied by both local and national leaders as well as top government officials, will launch projects that will open up roads in Mosop and Tinderet constituencies in Nandi and in Kesses Constituency in Uasin Gishu County.Sources said some of the roads include Kaiboi-Chepterwai-Kapkatembu-Kipkaren River road (40km), Kapkatembu- Kipkaren Selia-Kabiemit-Kaplemur-Lemok-Simat-Rivatex road (46km), Timboroa/Maraba/Songhor/Kobere, Lessos/Kesses road in Uasin Gishu.

This signifies government&#39;s commitment to fulfill pledges it made to residents,&quot; said Nandi governor.Lagat said they will ask the President to make another visit before 2017 election to launch more key projects.&quot;Only that the President is on a tight schedule, we would have expected him to commission Koitalel Samoei University, several water projects and a county referral hospital, among others,&quot; said Lagat.Mosop MP Kirwa Bitok lauded the Jubilee administration in what he termed &#39;ongoing fulfillment of key projects stretched across the country tailored at improving the economy&#39;.&quot;We have been lagging behind since independence and we are grateful the government has finally heard our cries. These projects will be beneficial to the region as well as neighbouring counties,&quot; he said.

He dismissed the Opposition saying they did nothing for the people when they were in government.&quot;Those questioning the timing of the launch of these projects should show us any viable initiatives they made while in government. They have nothing to show because they focused on their own selfish gains,&quot; he said.Uhuru and Ruto are likely to encounter demands for better pricing for dairy and tea&nbsp; during the visit. Last year, Uhuru officiated at the official opening of Nyayo Tea Zone Corporation factory Kipchabo in Chesumei Constituency in Nandi.The facility came in handy for farmers who incurred while transporting their produce to far off factories. However, farmers are still disgruntled with poor prices in first and second payment of bonuses.&quot;Tea prices are worrying, it seems the region was forgotten because farmers cannot even access subsidies yet they produce the best quality tea,&quot; said Paul Mugun a farmer in Nandi.The issue of subsidies and waivers for debts facing agricultural institutions including New Cooperative Creameries (NKCC), Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC), funding of Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) and full revival of Kenya Farmers Association are some of the issues that are also likely to emerge during the visit.

They also want the milk processor reverted to them.Dairy farmers in the region are also waiting for the promise made by the Jubilee administration that it will distribute milk coolers to every ward to assist in collecting and pasteurizing produce.&quot;There has been no feedback on when we shall receive the coolers,&quot; said Philip Kimaiyo from Ziwa area.Kenya Dairy Farmers Federation (KDFF) chairman Richard Tuwei alleged a plot to privatise NKCC without consulting farmers.&quot;NKCC has always been a stabilizer in the dairy industry and privatizing means its death. We should be told what is happening because we are key stakeholders in the company,&quot; said Tuwei.Kenya Farmers Association Director Kipkorir Menjo noted it will be difficult for the Jubilee administration to fulfill all the pledges it made in the run up to the 2013 General Election before the next polls. However, he is happy the government will improve local roads.
