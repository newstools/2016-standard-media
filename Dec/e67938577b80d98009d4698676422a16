CORD yesterday renewed its battle to stop changes made by the National Assembly to the electoral laws by going to court.In n suit filed at the High Court under certificate of urgency, CORD argued that an amendment to the Elections Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016 which allows the use of manual voting was a recipe for chaos in the August 2017 general elections. Through senior counsel James Orengo, the coalition wants the court to quash the proceedings at the National Assembly that led to the disputed changes in the law, and an order stopping the President from assenting the Bill in the event the Senate also passes it. &quot;The peace, security and safety of citizens and their property is likely to be compromised if the debate and legislation affecting the electoral law is undertaken without involvement of all stakeholders including political parties,&quot; said Senator Orengo.The coalition argued that the changes reflect what the Kriegler report warned could lead to chaos during elections.
