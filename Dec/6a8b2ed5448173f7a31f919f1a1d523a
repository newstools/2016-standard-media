&nbsp;A two-day medics&#39; strike was Wednesday night headed for collapse in parts of Coast after cracks emerged in the giant Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun). At Coast Provincial General Hospital (CPGH), nurses in unofficial uniforms were attending to patients as reports indicated that their counterparts in Lamu had called off the strike.&quot;I went to a private hospital yesterday (Tuesday) and the doctors prescribed medicine worth Sh16,000 for my boy. I decided to come here (CPGH) and I&#39;m happy he has been treated for free,&quot; said Ms Emily Atieno, the mother of a four-year-old son who was admitted yesterday after he was bitten by a snake.Nurses who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being seen as traitors said &quot;our conscience could not allow us to leave the child to die,&quot; adding that services being offered at the region&#39;s referral hospital were still low.
