Controversy has emerged in the Gabra clan after two rival sides held separate meetings to endorse a candidate for the Marsabit gubernatorial seat.The candidates to be picked involved incumbent Governor Ukur Yattani and US-based consultant Ummuro Adano. Both Mr Yattani and Mr Adano now claim they are the clan&rsquo;s flag-bearer in next year&rsquo;s General Election through a statement to the media.The governor, through the County Public Relations and Liaison Officer Alexander Barille said in a statement: &lsquo;&lsquo;Ambassador Ukur Yattani was blessed by elders at Kalacha before he was handed over to leaders from all communities forming a political alliance.&rsquo;&rsquo;The official alleged that elders rejected Adano on the basis that he had been away and thus did not attend to the welfare of the community in the last 30 years, and that he had failed to conform to traditions by &lsquo;boycotting&rsquo; the meeting. &lsquo;&lsquo;In his acceptance speech, Yattani thanked the community for the honour bestowed on him to continue leading them,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Barille.In a quick rejoinder, Adano said the supreme Gabra elders from five clans called Yaa endorsed him at Kalacha after the governor sensed defeat and failed to turn up.Hand-picked elders&lsquo;&lsquo;The Gabbra general assembly took place between December 2 and 6 in Kalacha town, Marsabit County. The event was attended by more than 2,000 people, including traditional elders from all Yaas (cultural institutions), professionals, youth and women. I attended the event on the evening of December 2 and stayed until the end of the session&rdquo; he said.He added: &ldquo;On the other hand, Mr Yattani chose to gather a small group of hand-picked elders and county staff and remained holed up in a nearby primary school. The assembly led by the Gathom (supreme) elders had no option but to bless and endorse me as sole gubernatorial candidate for the Gabbra community.&rsquo;&rsquo;Adano is backed by two prominent Gabra women - Sarah Godana, widow of veteran North Horr MP and Cabinet minister in the Moi era and Dibo Umuro, daughter of the late Marsabit North MP Umuro Issako.Yesterday,&nbsp;Umuro said she backs Adano; &lsquo;&lsquo;He (Adano) has a proven record of managing large multi-million-dollar development programmes. He has been leading technical teams and facilitating complex negotiations and involving multiple stakeholders,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.The duo, who have both vowed to vie, are expected to face National Hospital and Insurance Fund Chairman Mohamud Ali for the seat of governor in next year&rsquo;s General Election.
