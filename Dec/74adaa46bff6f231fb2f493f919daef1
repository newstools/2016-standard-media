Opposition leader Raila Odinga is set to tour Tharaka Nithi County Wednesday in a move that is likely to widen the political rift between two Jubilee camps in the county.The rivalry between Governor Samuel Ragwa and Senator Kithure Kindiki camps intensified two weeks ago after a divisive Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s tour in the county that was catapulted by Kindiki&#39;s camp as the governor camp appeared to be totally in the dark about the DP&#39;s itinerary.Ragwa&#39;s camp notable players are senatorial aspirant Francis Kiambi &quot;Matanka&quot; and Deputy Governor Eliud Mate while Kindiki&#39;s camp has gubernatorial aspirant and Chuka Igambangombe MP Muthomi Njuki and Kareke Mbiuki (Maara). Ruto&#39;s sentiments on the multimillion government&#39;s projects in Chuka town later triggered a debate on whether he had endorsed the town and not the gazetted Kathwana market as the headquarters of Mt Kenya&#39;s smallest county by population.The DP&#39;s office has since cleared the air that the sentiments meant Chuka town was the commercial headquarters and Kathwana the administrative headquarters.On Tuesday, the former PM&#39;s spokesman Dennis Onyango and the Cord Upper Eastern Region Campaign coordinator Mike Makarena confirmed that Raila would be visiting the county but did not provide any itinerary.But area ODM Chairman Martin Mugambi said the CORD co-principal tour is aiming at solidifying his support ahead of the general elections, including opening new party offices at Kathwana.He said the ODM leader will in future hold rallies and meetings with delegates across Upper Eastern region to expand the party&#39;s support base. Raila&#39;s ODM captured two parliamentary seats in larger Meru in 2013 although Tigania East&#39;s Mpuri Aburi and Igembe Central&#39;s Kubai Kiringo have since ditched the party for Jubilee and now face expulsion.Mugambi said CORD has laid down elaborate plans on how the party would reach out to jubilee zones to support Mr Odinga&#39;s presidential bid.&quot;We welcome Jubilee politicians who feel uncomfortable with their parties&rsquo; merger to join us and we are assuring them of genuine nominations,&quot; said Mugambi.Odinga will meet with delegates of the party at Kathwana after opening its new offices in the town before proceeding to address a public rally.The former PM&#39;s tour come a week after angry Kathwana residents on Wednesday last week blocked Mate road - the new highway between Embu and Meru through Tharaka region - demonstrating against Ruto&#39;s &#39;endorsement&#39; of Chuka. Some carried placard castigating the Jubilee administration and praising the ODM leader.The locals threatened to vote out Uhuru Kenyatta in next year&#39;s general election if his government failed to develop Kathwana town.Local politicians were yesterday trying to place blame on each other for the former PM&#39;s visit.Senator Kindiki accused the governor of dividing the county on tribal bases hence causing a stagnation of national government projects.Ragwa through his Director of Communications Douglas Kaunda said he was not involved, had no clue and had nothing to do with Raila&#39;s visit.&quot;Ragwa is squarely in Jubilee bedroom and we hope the governor&#39;s opponents have not organised this visit so that they can use it as part of their propaganda against him,&quot; said Kaunda.?
