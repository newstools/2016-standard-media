CAIRO: Six policemen were killed and three injured on Friday when a bomb exploded at a security checkpoint in Cairo, security sources said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack in Al Haram street leading to the Pyramids, in which four civilians were also hurt. The policemen were either in or close to their car when the device went off in or near a garbage can, the sources said. The attack, close to a government building in a middle class neighbourhood of Cairo, was the latest in a series of security incidents in Egypt often claimed by radical Islamists. Security forces killed three gunmen on Tuesday in a raid on a hideout in southern Egypt used by armed wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, which claimed responsibility in September for an assassination attempt on a senior prosecutor
