When I informed him that my intention was to join KANU (and not NARC as he had anticipated), he simply told me to go back to the army,&rdquo; said Nkaiserry amid laughter.He added: &ldquo;But I told him I was a general and I could not back down so I worked my way up through his guidance to where I am today.&rdquo;Nack Kenya party leader Martha Karua recalled her time with the politician when she moved from Ford Asili to DP.&ldquo;Keen was my mentor.

He has left a mark and legacy that all of us should emulate,&rdquo; said Ms Karua.Keen&rsquo;s death was described by Narok Senator Stephen ole Ntutu as a rude shock to the Maasai considering it was barely three months after the death of another veteran leader from the community, William ole Ntimama.&ldquo;Even if we have lost Ntimama and now Keen, I ask our people not to be shaken. We still have many like them among us who will take up the mantle and continue with their agenda,&rdquo; said Mr Ntutu.

It was not unusual for my children to seek guidance from him and at times, he would act as emissary between them and my husband,&rdquo; said Dorcas.In the event, aspirants in the 2017 elections were asked to emulate the peaceful ways of Keen, and warned to steer clear of politics of division.Nkaissery said he would never, under his watch, allow a repeat of the 2007 post-election violence that saw thousands displaced and others killed.
