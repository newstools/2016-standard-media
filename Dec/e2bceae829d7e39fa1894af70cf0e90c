Public hospitals in Mt Kenya region remained closed yesterday as patients sought treatment in private institutions.Although some nurses had resumed duty in certain institutions, doctors were still unavailable to treat patients.In Embu, patients flocked to private and faith-based hospitals for treatment as the nationwide strike by health workers paralysed operations in public hospitals. Those who could not afford the high medical fees charged in private hospitals returned home untreated to wait for the strike to be called off.At the Embu Level Five Hospital, the management discharged all the 450 patients except 14 in surgical wards with minor cases and locked the doors to the vacated wards to secure them. ENDED STRIKENurses are yet to return to work even after an announcement that some union leaders had ended their strike.The doctors&#39; strike is compounded by the fact that they had downed their tools for three weeks demanding promotion and employment of more medics, even before the nationwide strike kicked off.Embu Level Five medical superintendent Dr Henry Njiru said they waived the bills of several patients, and agreed with their relatives to offset the hospital expenses later.He said the hospital was only attending to a few outpatient; emergency cases and the 14 patients in the surgical ward who had sustained fractures and traumas.&quot;The nursing administrators and I are handling the situation assisted by the clinical officers and some 10 nurses employed on contractual basis and nurses pursuing further studies but now on internship. We are offering most of the outpatient services except specialised clinics,&quot; he said.REMAINED GROUNDEDHealth services in Murang&#39;a remained grounded as the health workers claimed those who called off the strike were imposters.Tens of patients who rushed to various facilities to seek treatment returned home frustrated as the entrances remained closed with security guards patrolling the compounds.A section of health workers camped at Murang&#39;a District Hospital speaking in low tones before they walked to General Ihura Stadium for the Jamhuri Day celebrations.
