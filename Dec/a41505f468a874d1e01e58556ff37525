The Council of Governors now wants officials of a doctors&#39; union jailed for refusing to call off the ongoing strike.Through lawyer Eunice Lumallas, CoG argued that officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) had repeatedly defied a court order that declared their strike illegal and continued to put the lives of thousands of patients at risk. &quot;The doctors are in outright contempt of court. We urge the court to find them guilty of disobeying the court order and issue a warrant of arrest for the union officials and for them to be sent to civil jail,&quot; Ms Lumallas said.But the union maintained that it would not call off the strike until talks between them and the Government over implementation of the 2013 collective bargaining agreement were concluded.At the same time, CoG withdrew their case against the Kenya National Union of Nurses and filed a consent between them that ended their strike last week.

The governors also want doctors compelled to pay damages for injuries caused to thousands of patients and deaths that have occurred as a result of their strike.&quot;The doctors have proceeded to go on an unlawful and unprotected strike thereby gravely affecting the health and well-being of patients. Their action is harming vulnerable people who need medical care and the court needs to intervene to stop them,&quot; Lumallas argued.She added that KMPDU should be held personally responsible for calling the strike, arguing that their continued disregard of the court order lowered the court&#39;s dignity and made people lose trust in the Judiciary.
