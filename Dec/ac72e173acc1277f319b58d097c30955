Kenya News Agency (KNA) has partnered with the ICT Authority to launch a digital library to showcase Kenya&rsquo;s history as captured on camera.The library will be available on online web portal - www.urithi.go.ke - and is expected to showcase more than one million historical images and nearly 5,000 hours of videos as old as 70 years. Watermarked low-resolution digital copies of KNA multimedia assets will be viewable at no cost online. The agency will also offer licences for personal and commercial reproduction of its assets.Broadcast and Telecommunication Principal Secretary Sammy Itemere said the collection will feature a mix of free public access licences and fee-based licences to make the library sustainable. However, the agency is yet to determine the fee structure for the various licences it will offer.&nbsp;
