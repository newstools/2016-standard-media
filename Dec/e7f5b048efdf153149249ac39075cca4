Three&nbsp;grand&nbsp;hotels,&nbsp;three&nbsp;mosques&nbsp;and a church built&nbsp;near&nbsp;a military facility in Nairobi risk&nbsp;demolition&nbsp;for contravening building regulations. The seven are on a list of 45 developments identified by the Nairobi County Government, following a complaint from&nbsp;Moi&nbsp;Air&nbsp;Base&nbsp;(Eastleigh) Commander on May 5, on their continued encroachment on the facility. They include eleven-storey Grand Royal&nbsp;Hotel, seven-floor Barakat&nbsp;Hotel&nbsp;and eight-storey Solar Lodge built on plot number. All the&nbsp;three&nbsp;hotels&nbsp;are said to have exceeded the permitted number of floor levels allowed in the area while Grand Royal&nbsp;Hotel&nbsp;and Barakat lack occupation certificates. The&nbsp;demolitionnotices were issued on separate dates in 2009 and 2010. The&nbsp;three&nbsp;mosques&nbsp;facing&nbsp;uncertain future include a four-storey one built along the fence of the airbase, one also built close to the fence and another on Eastleigh Second Avenue. The&nbsp;mosques&nbsp;are four storeys each, exceeding the&nbsp;three-floor limit for buildings&nbsp;near&nbsp;the&nbsp;air&nbsp;base. Some were built without approval from city authorities, while others lack occupation certificates. The PAG church is next to the&nbsp;air&nbsp;base&nbsp;fence with a 12-metre road between it and the airbase.

For those like the ones in Eastleigh, the law will take its course. The buildings will have to come down at some point,&rdquo; Governor Evans Kidero told The Standard on Saturday. Also on the condemned list are tens of residential flats, which have exceeded approval limits or encroached on the 15m buffer zone of the&nbsp;air&nbsp;base&nbsp;and lack occupation certificates. Structures must be at least 15m from the fence of the airbase. They also include poorly built structures and flats next to the airport fence and wall, occupied plots immediately before the&nbsp;air&nbsp;base&nbsp;boundary wall, temporary garages encroaching on the fence into existing 17th Street plot, and low rise residential developments with 12-metre-wide road between them and the&nbsp;air&nbsp;base. Twenty-six of the 45 properties had been issued with&nbsp;demolition&nbsp;notices by May. It was not immediately clear whether the remaining 19 have since been issued with the notices. In April 2010, the grand coalition Cabinet of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga authorised the&nbsp;demolition&nbsp;of all illegal structures around airports and other strategic installations such the&nbsp;Moi&nbsp;Airbase. By October of the same year, the&nbsp;demolitions&nbsp;were authorised but before&nbsp;demolition&nbsp;squads could move into Eastleigh, the exercise was stopped and the agencies involved required to appear before parliamentary committees on national security, lands, housing and local authorities. A number of developers in Eastleigh also moved to court and obtained injunctions against the&nbsp;demolitions. A total of eight constitutional petitions were filed against the former City Council of Nairobi and the Attorney General on behalf of the Kenya&nbsp;Air&nbsp;Force and Department of Defence. Much later in 2012, the Kenya National Audit Office carried out a forensic audit of the&nbsp;demolitions&nbsp;that had happened and faulted the squads, as well as those who had approved the structures or allocated the plots. &ldquo;We are determined to restore order in the city. All properties which will miss out on this regularisation, including the Eastleigh ones, will be brought down or taken over by the county government,&rdquo; Kidero said. Regularisation entails inspecting buildings to ensure they&nbsp;meet planning regulations, are structurally sound and have paid fees.
