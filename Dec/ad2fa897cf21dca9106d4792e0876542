Striking doctors risk losing their jobs after 45 county governments advertised for their replacements.This is the latest move by the county governments to mitigate the collapse of the health sector that has crippled operations across the country. The strike, which enters its fourth week today, has been a headache for both the counties and the national government.Proposals for replacing the medics with foreign doctors from Cuba, the Philippines and India have also been floated.Despite numerous talks to have the doctors return to work spearheaded by the ministries of Health and Labour, no consensus has been reached despite the Government raising the medics&rsquo; salaries in a structure that would see the lowest paid Sh185,000 from Sh126,000, and the highest - in Job Group T - taking home Sh425,000, which is almost half of what they are demanding (Sh852,000).

KMPDU has strongly criticised the credibility of the plan.&ldquo;The move by the Government is just naive and a drop in the ocean. It will not be a surprise to see quack doctors being ferried in through this expatriate programme,&rdquo; said the union&rsquo;s secretary general, Ouma Oluga.Dr Oluga said as a union, they would verify the competence of the doctors before they were absorbed into the system.He confirmed that the union was in touch with the World Medical Organisation to ensure that all the expatriates sent to the country were qualified.

And India has been in the news for having 57 per cent of the doctors not qualified, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).In July, WHO revealed in a report titled &lsquo;The Health Workforce in India&rsquo; that more than a third (31 per cent) of doctors (basically physicians who should be capable of diagnosing and treating ailments and disorders) were educated only up to secondary school level.And some 57 per cent of these did not have any medical qualifications. In rural India, 82 per cent of the doctors had no medical qualifications.Efforts to reach the relevant offices, including the President&rsquo;s and Government&rsquo;s spokespersons, for insight into the deal with expatriate doctors were futile as both calls and messages went unanswered.&ldquo;The doctors pushed their strike to a level that people are seeking alternatives,&rdquo; was all Eric Kiraithe, the Government spokesman, said.
