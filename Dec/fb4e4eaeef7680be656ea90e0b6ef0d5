The Government has embarked on a hunt for more investors for the planned multi-billion-shilling technology hub, Konza Technology City.This follows the launch of a new strategic plan to guide the development of the smart city into an outsourcing powerhouse attracting both local and international vendors and service providers.&ldquo;The implementation of Phase 1 of Konza Technopolis is already in progress and is expected to attract 30,000 residents, 7,500 knowledge workers and 16,700 other workers upon completion,&rdquo; explained ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru, while launching the strategic plan. Mr Mucheru further stated the Government had already settled on a contractor to fund development of key infrastructure with the Government keen on scaling up the work. &ldquo;So far we have concluded procuring a contractor who will come with finance for the construction of Streetscape and sub-surface utilities, wastewater treatment and recycling facility and a bulk water treatment,&rdquo; he said.Other installation works pegged for the initial phase of construction include fibre-optic links, power stations and sub-stations as a solid waste management system.Former president Mwai Kibaki launched the Konza City development project in 2010 as part of the country&rsquo;s Vision 2030 development plan.Over the years, however, the project has been mired in skepticism over the ability of the proposed city to attract enough financial backing. Konza now states that Phase 1A of the project constituting the leasing out of the 60 acres of land to investors is expected to be complete by March 2017 after a successful expression of interest by both local and multi-national companies.&ldquo;I want to take this opportunity to rally the business community, local and international investors to take advantage of the opportunity this project presents to us,&rdquo; explained Konza CEO John Tanui.According to the Konza information website, the city wants to attract business process outsourcing, software development, data centres, disaster recovery centres, call centres and light assembly manufacturing industries.A university campus focused on research and technology as well as hotels, residential areas, schools and hospitals will also be built.
