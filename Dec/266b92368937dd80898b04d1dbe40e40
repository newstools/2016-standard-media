Time Magazine named U.S. President-elect Donald Trump its person of the year on Wednesday, citing the upheaval in American politics brought about by the New York businessman&#39;s election campaign and victory. &quot;It&#39;s hard to measure the scale of his disruption,&quot; Time said in its announcement, noting Trump&#39;s career as real estate magnate and reality television star before he won the presidency on Nov. 8. The Republican president-elect, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, ran an unconventional and controversial campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Time noted that views of him were deeply divided. &quot;For those who believe this is all for the better, Trump&#39;s victory represents a long-overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class,&quot; the magazine said. &quot;For those who see it as for the worse, the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse, a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism, sexism, nativism.&quot; ALSO READ: Defying Trump, Green Party pursues recounts in three states The magazine said its short list for person of the year included Clinton, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and singer Beyonce. &quot;It&#39;s a great honor, it means a lot,&quot; Trump told NBC&#39;s &quot;Today&quot; show in an interview shortly after the announcement. But he rejected Time&#39;s characterization of the country as fractured. The magazine&#39;s cover called him the &quot;president of the divided states of America.&quot; &quot;I didn&#39;t divide them, they&#39;re divided now,&quot; he told NBC. &quot;We&#39;re going to put it back together.&quot; He added: &quot;I think putting &#39;divided&#39; is snarky.&quot; Time makes its annual choice based on the impact a person has on world events, for better or for worse. Last year the magazine chose German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Previous winners have ranged from Mahatma Gandhi to Adolf Hitler.
