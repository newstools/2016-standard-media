Ford Kenya Party legislators have vowed to reject a motion seeking to reduce the number of counties to 46. Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi and Nominated Senator Catherine Mukite vowed to lobby their colleagues to vote against the Bill on grounds that it is against the spirit of devolution. The Bill by Deputy Senate Speaker and Murang&rsquo;a Senator Kembi Gitura seeks to have Nairobi County scrapped from the list of counties and put under the National Government leadership where it will be referred to as the National Capital City. According to the Bill set for introduction into the Senate, the President will have the power to nominate a Cabinet Secretary to take charge of the city after parliament approval. -Osinde Obare ALSO READ: Nairobi County to digitise lands registry by February
