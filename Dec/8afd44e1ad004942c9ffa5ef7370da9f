Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka Wednesday called on residents to support President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election bid.&quot;I want to urge our people not to waste their votes on the Opposition because it will lose in next year&#39;s General Election,&quot; Munyaka said when he accompanied the President who is on a two-day tour of the region considered an Opposition stronghold. He also told Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to lead Kambas into Jubilee &#39;to save them from another five years in the political cold&#39;.The MP said intolerance and the hard positions taken by a section of Kalonzo&#39;s allies are to blame &#39;for the slow pace of development in counties in the entire region&#39;.&quot;Kambas must wake up and join Jubilee Party. We must refuse to be herded into a political outfit like sheep,&quot; he said and thanked the Government for its plan to upgrade the Kibwezi-Mutomo-Kitui-Migwani road which he noted had been in a sorry state for many years.
