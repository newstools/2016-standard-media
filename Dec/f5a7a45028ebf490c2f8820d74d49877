KIAMBU: A group of widows is appealing to the Opposition to shelf calls for mass action and give dialogue a chance. The group, Mungaano wa Wajane, said mass action called over the amendments made to the election laws will only bring chaos and make the already delicate situation worse. Led by its chairperson Bertha Gaitho, the group said dialogue and consensus between the Opposition and the Government was the only way out to solve the impasse.
