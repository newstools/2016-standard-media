&nbsp; Fifteen families in Tayari, Molo sub-county, spent the night in the cold Thursday after a fire destroyed their homes. The fire broke out at around 11am in the residential houses following a suspected electrical fault. One of the victims, Micheal Karanja, said he was doing casual jobs in Molo town when he received a phone call from his neighbour about the fire. Mr Karanja said he rushed home to find that the fire was spreading so fast that it was difficult to salvage his belonging. &quot;I found all my property burnt,&quot; he said. He said efforts by neighbours and rescuers to put the fire out bore no fruit due to lack of proper equipment. &quot;The fire was spreading fast and locals were using tree branches and soil to put it out,&quot; he said. Mary Wangere, another victim, said the county government should station fire fighters at Molo trading centre. The mother of three, who had gone to work in Molo town, said all her property was destroyed. &quot;I received a phone call from someone saying our houses had caught fire but by the time I arrived, mine was gone,&quot; she said. And Regina Wanjiku, another victim, pleaded with well-wishers to provide them with shelter, clothes, food and household items. Ms Wanjiku said it was unfortunate that lack of quick response had led to the destruction of all her property. Molo Officer Commanding Police Division Daniel Kamanze said investigations were underway to establish the cause of the fire. He however cautioned residents to be careful with electricity to avoid loss of property and life.
