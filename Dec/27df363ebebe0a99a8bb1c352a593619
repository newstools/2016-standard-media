KANU&nbsp;chairman Gideon Moi Wednesday said his political differences with Deputy President William Ruto are not personal, but emanate from unfulfilled development promises.The Baringo senator, who castigated Ruto over insults allegedly directed at other Rift Valley leaders, also blamed the DP&#39;s allies, led by Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, for defending him even when he is wrong. Speaking at Bartolimo in Baringo County, Gideon said Ruto has been using his visits in Baringo, Nandi, Kericho and other parts of the region to tarnish his name to get sympathy votes. He said he will work with Ruto only if the development promises are fulfilled.The senator said he is only concerned with the interests of Kenyans and not any group or individual and asked his political competitors not to feel bitter.&quot;Murkomen, get it from me, even if you come to Baringo with ten helicopters and several senators, people of this county have made up their minds,&#39;&#39; he said.

Gideon, I have no problem supporting you after Ruto. The deputy president deserves respect and that is exactly what we are asking from KANU,&quot; said Murkomen.Gideon, however, told him off, saying he was the best placed to understand the former Head of State.Wednesday, Kanu and Jubilee politicians who shared the same platform differed sharply over the Jubilee development record.Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ngeno said Jubilee should blame itself for failing to fulfill promises it made during the 2013 General Election.He said Gideon deserves unconditional respect especially from people who never voted for him.
