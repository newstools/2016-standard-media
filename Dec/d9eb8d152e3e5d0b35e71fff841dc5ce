Former assistant minister John Keen will go down in history books as one who successfully fought to clear his name in a paternity suit filed by a woman who claimed to be his daughter.Ruby Karimi, 35, claimed Keen had constantly rejected her despite her spirited efforts to have him acknowledge that he was her biological father. Karimi relied on a statement attached to the affidavit and which her mother, Janet Ekumbo, signed.In her affidavit filed at the High Court, Ekumbo claimed the former assistant minister forced himself into her room at Namanga River Hotel.Ekumbo claimed that towards the end of October 1980, she was on her way from Moshi, Tanzania, when she booked into the hotel where she allegedly met the retired politician.

The incident alleged to have occurred 36 years or so ago, was never reported to the police, and as I understand her evidence to be, the petitioner&#39;s mother never spoke of the alleged rape to any one, not her brother with whom she was living, nor her father,&quot; the judge found.While opposing the case, Keen argued that Karimi had not identified to the court any specific rights that had been violated and the manner in which the rights had been violated.The former assistant minister also denied knowledge of both Karimi and her mother.
