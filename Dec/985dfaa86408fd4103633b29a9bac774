Christmas has been &quot;taken hostage&quot; by dazzling materialism that puts God in the shadows and blinds many to the needs of the hungry, the migrants and the war weary, Pope Francis has said.Francis, leading the world&#39;s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics into Christmas for the fourth time since his election in 2013, said in his Christmas Eve homily that a world often obsessed with gifts, feasting and self-centerdness needed more humility. &quot;If we want to celebrate Christmas authentically, we need to contemplate this sign: The fragile simplicity of a small new-born, the meekness of where he lies, the tender affection of the swaddling clothes. God is there,&quot; the Pope said at St Peter&#39;s Basilica.At the solemn but joyous service, attended by some 10,000 people as well as dozens of cardinals and bishops, Pope Francis said the many in the wealthy world had to be reminded that the message of Christmas was humility, simplicity and mystery.&quot;Jesus was born rejected by some and regarded by many others with indifference,&quot; he said.

It needs to be freed.&quot;Security was heightened for the Christmas weekend in Italy and at the Vatican after Italian police killed the man believed to be responsible for the Berlin market truck attack while other European cities kept forces on high alert.CLEARED OUTSt Peter&#39;s Square was cleared out six hours before the mass began at the basilica so that security procedures could be put in place for those entering the church later.Francis, who has made defence of the poor a trademark of his papacy, said the infant Jesus should remind everyone of those suffering today, particularly children.&quot;Let us also allow ourselves to be challenged by the children of today&#39;s world, who are not lying in a cot caressed with the affection of a mother and father, but rather suffer the squalid mangers that devour dignity: Hiding underground to escape bombardment, on the pavements of a large city, at the bottom of a boat over-laden with immigrants,&quot; he said.

At the same time the pontiff paid tribute on Monday to Middle East Christians who have clung to their faith during persecution by Islamist militants, saying there are more Christians martyrs now than in the Church&#39;s early days.The pope spoke to thousands of people in St Peter&#39;s Square for his holiday blessing on the feast of St Stephen, the first Christian martyr.He mentioned the persecution of Christians in Iraq, many of whom were able to spend their first Christmas since 2013 in churches after towns and cities were retaken from Islamic State.&quot;This was an example of fidelity to the Gospel,&quot; he said. &quot;Despite trials and dangers, they courageously show that they belong to Christ,&quot; he said. &quot;Today, we want to think of them and be close to them with our affection, our prayers and even our tears.&quot;NORTHERN REGIONSChristians in northern regions of Iraq held by Islamic State were given an ultimatum: Pay a tax, convert to Islam, or die by the sword. Most of them fled to the autonomous Kurdish region to the east.

Obama has led a military fighting overseas, becoming the only president in US history to serve two full terms with the nation at war.The president, who spent Christmas Eve calling troops serving overseas, pointed out that as Americans celebrate the holidays, US troops are serving in dangerous, remote places&nbsp;like Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp;
