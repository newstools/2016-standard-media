The frequent attacks in Baringo County by suspected Pokot raiders call for a change of strategy. The turn the attacks are taking shows how courageous and daring the raiders are getting.In the latest attack on Monday evening, they attempted to overrun a General Service Unit camp at Kiserian. County police commandant Robinson Ndiwa is on record saying that the raiders are now targeting security officers, who are a stumbling block to their raid missions. The Government is planning an operation to mop up arms. But experience has taught that it is innocent victims who end up suffering during such operations.The raiders will have long crossed the border to a neighbouring country. Once the operation is over, they will make their way back. The Government should pursue a community-based solution to deal with the menace. It should try to work with local leaders, elders and religious leaders in these areas.The raiders are well known to the locals. Most of the issues giving rise to such raids are deeply rooted in culture.The Government must promote and help facilitate inter-community peace initiatives and dialogue. It can also help strengthen local mechanisms of conflict resolution. This will be far much effective than a mop-up operation.
