Nominated MP Oburu Odinga&#39;s bid for the Bondo parliamentary seat received a boost when two ODM governors and an MP endorsed him.This comes a few weeks after Oburu announced that he would be contesting against the incumbent, Gideon Ochanda, eliciting mixed reactions from residents.Speaking during a fundraiser in Bondo over the weekend, Governors Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Cornel Rasanga (Siaya) and Nyando MP Fred Outa said Oburu was the best bet for the parliamentary seat given his development track record. Speaker after speaker called on Mr Ochanda to shelve his parliamentary ambitions and get ready to join the county government.Mr Outa called on Ochanda to allow Oburu to take the parliamentary seat as he (Ochanda) moved to the county.&quot;My friend Ochanda is a technocrat and has a lot of knowledge that can help build Siaya,&quot; said Outa, adding that this should be done for peace to prevail in Bondo and the entire county.He argued that if Oburu and Ochanda engaged in political battles, it would destabilise ODM leader Raila Odinga&#39;s presidential bid.He said that since Siaya was the bedrock of Luo-Nyanza politics, they should have a 2017 line-up in place before the end of the year.Governor Rasanga said Alego, where he comes from, would work hand in hand with Bondo.&quot;Bondo delivered me the highest votes and I am requesting my friend Ochanda to help me get more votes in 2017,&quot; said Rasanga.Rasanga&#39;s sentiments were echoed by Mr Awiti, who said Ochanda had a sharp brain that could help turn the county around.But when he stood up to speak, Oburu called for healthy political competition devoid of physical confrontation.&quot;We have contested against each other more than twice and we have never engaged in a physical fight. All we need here in Bondo is a peaceful election where the loser concedes and supports the winner,&quot; said Oburu.Ochanda said there was need to discuss the matter before the party nominations to avoid chaos during the polls.&quot;The deputy governor&#39;s position is not elective and as a sitting MP, I cannot just sit and wait to be picked by the party&#39;s nominated governor. I want to secure my MP&#39;s certificate first then other discussions can follow,&quot; he said.Rasanga&#39;s deputy, Ouma Onyango, who appeared uncomfortable with Ochanda being fronted as Rasanga&#39;s running mate in 2017, declared that he would vote for Oburu.&quot;I voted for Ochanda in the last elections but this time I will vote for Oburu,&quot; he said.
