Hunger, corruption and the high cost of living are the most serious problems facing Kenyans, according to a survey released by Ipsos yesterday.The survey, conducted between December 17-19, shows that 17 per cent of Kenyans across the country barely have enough to eat due to drought. It further found that Kenyans were overburdened by the high cost of living and bogged down by the effects of corruption.It rated corruption as the second biggest concern across the country, at 16 per cent. Nairobi residents considered graft the most serious problem (25 per cent) while North Eastern residents were the least bothered by vice (12).&quot;Nairobi is the headquarters of the National Government and most of the media are here. So the residents tend to be more informed on corruption issues than those in other regions,&quot; explained Ipsos Research Analyst Tom Wolf.

However, 62 per cent of Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD)&nbsp;supporters think otherwise.TRIBAL IDENTITYIn the survey, only 29 per cent of CORD supporters have been impressed by the President&#39;s efforts.&quot;Of course corruption incidents have become synonymous with governance. Voting in Kenya is a question of how more of a politician&#39;s candidature is based on his tribal identity than on his performance,&quot; said Wolf.
