A Sh350 million cruise ship handling facility has been launched at the port of Mombasa. The state-of-the-art facility will replace Mombasa Port Shade 1 and 2 established in 1926 and which has been handling cruise liners. While commissioning the facility yesterday, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said the project will be a game changer and is expected to be completed in July 2017. Mr Balala, who was flanked by his Principal Secretary Fatuma Hirsi Mohamed, revealed that TradeMark East Africa contributed Sh100 million while Kenya Ports Authority pumped in Sh250 million towards the project. Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho, TradeMark East Africa&#39;s David Stantton and KPA General Manager (infrastructure development) Abdulahi Samatar were present during the launch.
