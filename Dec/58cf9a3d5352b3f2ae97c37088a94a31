Jubilee Party rivals will sabotage President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election bid by popularising Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s 2022 bid, Governor Peter Munya has said.The Council of Governors (CoG) chairman accused Senator Kiraitu Murungi of failing to protect Uhuru&#39;s government by taking a faulty Elections Act to Parliament that necessitated amendments. Kiraitu was the joint chairman of the parliamentary group that midwifed electoral reforms and proposed amendments to the Elections Act and the Political Parties Act.Parliament is to consider whether to amend a clause in the Elections Act that restricts the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to using electronic voter transmission.&quot;Are they really concerned about Uhuru&#39;s 2017 re-election when they cannot protect him through consensus legislation?&quot; Mr Munya asked.

All the time, they forget to tell the people that Ruto&#39;s bid will primarily depend on whether Uhuru is re-elected next year,&quot; he argued.He said while he would not drop his ambitions for the presidency in 2022 for Ruto as demanded by other Meru leaders such as Kiraitu and Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi, he would campaign vigorously for Uhuru in the run-up to the 2017 elections.The governor said the Jubilee Party branch elections in Meru had been hijacked by powerful politicians and would trigger defections by those wary of being rigged out in the party primaries.&quot;We welcome anybody dissatisfied with the internal democracy in the party to join PNU, which promises to pick only the best as its candidate,&quot; said Munya.Yesterday, he met a delegation of PNU officials and election hopefuls in Nyandarua County.
