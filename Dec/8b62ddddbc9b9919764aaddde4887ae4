The role of internal audit departments in county governments has come under fresh scrutiny following the Auditor General flagging of billions worth of unsupported expenditure.According to Commissioner on Revenue Allocation (CRA) Chair Micah Cheserem, a bulk of queries raised by Auditor General Edward Ouko about county spending can be resolved by internal auditors. &quot;Audit queries can include outright theft, inappropriate expenditure where there is no value for money spent and faults in book-keeping,&quot; he explained. &quot;What we need to do is distinguish between the three because I believe that up to 80 per cent of these queries that have been raised can be clarified by internal auditors.&quot;Last week, a leaked audit report by the office of the Auditor General revealed that Sh20 billion from the Nairobi County Council budget is unaccounted for.Several other counties including Kilifi, Wajir and Muranga have also been adversely mentioned in the latest audit report that has raised ire among governors.

At least 84 per cent of public sector auditors were also found to hold board positions in the same institution while 67 per cent had no provisions for a succession.&quot;The Auditor General&#39;s office is also very poorly resourced and overstretched and we want governors to sit with the Auditor General so that cases of unsupported expenditure or inappropriate expenditure can be cleared before the report is released,&quot; stated Cheserem.
