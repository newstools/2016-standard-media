Efforts to end medics&rsquo; strike have hit a dead end after the Nakuru County Government failed to agree with nurses.The Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) has vowed to continue with the strike until 774 healthcare workers are promoted and payment of promotion arrears is effected by the county. Knun Industrial Labour Officer David Omulama said talks with Health Executive Mungai Kabii and his Chief Officer Samuel Mwaura had been fruitless.Mr&nbsp;Omulama said since the strike began on December 1, they only met on December 16.He said negotiations failed after the county demanded that the union must call off the strike before substantive talks.
