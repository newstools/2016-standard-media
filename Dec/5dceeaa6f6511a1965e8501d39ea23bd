Nairobi: The top 2016 KCPE candidate scored 436 marks out of a possible 500, compared to last year&rsquo;s 449 in results announced by Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i. Only 5,190 candidates scored 400 and above, a drop from 2015&rsquo;s 7,560. There were no cases of examination leakage in exams that have been described as the most guarded in Kenya&rsquo;s history. Consequently, no candidate or examination will have their results cancelled. The timing is a clear break from tradition for the results which are usually released at the end of December. Matiang&rsquo;i has been on a mission to change how national examinations in Kenya are conducted; this year&rsquo;s KCPE and KCSE examinations were completed earlier than usual.
