The county government failed to inform us on what was going on but we will not let it go,&quot; he said.James Njuguna, a resident of Sipili, noted the discrepancies in the receipts when he visited the county offices in Nyahururu where he was asked for Sh1,500 for the rates. When he went to Rumuruti, he was asked for Sh2,000 for the same.Lawyers Makara Ngure and Njeri Kagiri, who will represent the complainants, said members of the public ought to have been consulted before the fees were imposed.&quot;We have been asked to institute legal measures against the Laikipia County Government for going against the will of the people of Laikipia.
