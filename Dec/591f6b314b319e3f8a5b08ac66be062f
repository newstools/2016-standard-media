It will take 14 days to approve domestic houses or single dwelling houses while major commercial projects will take a maximum of 30 days. Approvals used to take at least three months before.&ldquo;Kiambu is the fastest urbanising county in Kenya. We need to control such a growth so that we don&rsquo;t become a slum in the next 20 to 30 years,&rdquo; said David Gatimu, the Lands and Physical Planning chief officer.Kiambu County Governor William Kabogo said he was happy about the online platform, which took about six months to develop.

World Bank has also supported the implementation of electronic construction permits in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu counties.According to Frank Twagira, the World Bank Group Manager Investment Climate Kenya, the platform makes it easy to do business.

It is automated from planning, building permits and approvals, occupancy permits, conducting inspections online using smartphones and iPads,&rdquo; said Twagira.He added: &ldquo;We have heard testimonies of the benefits of the platform where the process used to take four to five months now taking 30 days and we hope other counties will adopt it since it also helps in revenue collection, hence cutting out middlemen.&rdquo;The counties and the World Bank share the cost of installing the system, with the county taking the bigger share. The Architectural Association of Kenya and Town and County Planners Association of Kenya have applauded Kiambu for the initiative.
