Eleven constituencies are unable to explain how they spent millions of shillings from taxpayers&rsquo; money. A report by the Auditor General accuses some of wasting of Constituency Development Fund (CDF) cash on suspect projects. &ldquo;Some of the projects have not been implemented yet they were allocated money,&rdquo; says the report for the year ending June 30, 2014. Of the 12 constituencies in the county, only Butere, represented in Parliament by Andrew Toboso, was given a clean bill of health.&nbsp; In Mumias West, a dispensary built at a cost of Sh 2.7 million remains unutilised. Worse, it has been declared uninhabitable by the public health officer. The report further says no documents were provided to confirm how the money was used. &ldquo;There is no value for money because locals are not getting the services they expected from the dispensary,&rdquo; says the report.

The constituency, represented in Parliament by Johnson Naicca, did not provide supporting documents to show how Sh7,024,464 in committee allowances was utilised. &ldquo;There was no proof also that some Sh17,725,000 meant for bursaries reached intended beneficiaries,&rdquo; says the report. Lurambi constituency is also on the spot after the building of a Sh52,464,576 CDF office in Kakamega Town stalled. &ldquo;The project that started in 2008-2009 was last allocated money in 2011-2012 even though the funds were not released before the 2013-2014 financial year. The project has stalled since 2011, hence no benefit has been derived from the expenditure of the money,&rdquo; says the auditor. Khwisero, whose MP is Benjamin Andola, could not explain expenditure of an extra Sh38,210,583. While the approved budget for projects was Sh86,901,961, the CDF team went ahead to spent Sh125,112,545.

Further, receiving institutions only acknowledged Sh18,694,452, raising the question of whether beneficiaries really received all the money set aside. The Navakholo CDF office also failed to account for Sh1.5 million paid out to complete the construction of an armoury and a septic tank at the then District Commissioner&rsquo;s office. Ownership documents were not produced for land the Ikolomani CDF committee purchased for Sh6.5 million for two primary schools, an Administration Police camp, a district hospital and a youth polytechnic. The report also showed that Likuyani constituency failed to spend money allocated to it. Out of the Sh77,911,938 the constituency was allocated, Sh36,505,623 remain unused.
