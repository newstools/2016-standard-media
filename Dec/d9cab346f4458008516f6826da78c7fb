In March, blogger Ezer Kipkurui was arrested in Nakuru town after a security officer accused him of taking photos of a long queue at a Government service centre.News of the arrest spread fast and sparked outrage online. Mr Kipkurui&rsquo;s arrest was the latest in a spate of cases that had seen bloggers and social media users across the country arrested and arraigned in court on all manner of charges. &ldquo;Accusations against me were ridiculous! Changing from resisting arrest and photography to causing disturbance,&rdquo; Kipkurui told his social media followers when he was released 12 hours later.Increasing intoleranceHis arrest and detention is one of the cases that has been used to illustrate Kenya&rsquo;s increasing intolerance to freedom of expression online.

Similar apps like Telegram, Viber, Facebook Messenger, Line, Imo, and Google Hangouts were also targeted.Aside from intrusive surveillance and censorship, the other danger Kenyan Internet users are exposed to today is fake news, a phenomenon that has been gaining currency since last month&rsquo;s election of Donald Trump as US president.Days after his surprising election victory, it was revealed that a large portion of news consumed by Trump supporters through social media was inaccurate.Freedom House warns that manipulated content online is a growing problem globally, with signs that Kenyan users could be falling victim. &ldquo;In Kenya&rsquo;s increasingly partisan environment, observers note hired bloggers and twitter bots on both sides of the political divide are increasingly crowding out diverse and independent viewpoints with partisan commentary on social media,&rdquo; warned Freedom House.The reduced cost of data and devices has allowed more people to build an online following through content creation and delivering alternative sources of news.Further, Internet users have made some gains this year, including the High Court&rsquo;s decision in April to declare Section 29 (b) of the Kenya Information and Communication Act unconstitutional.The controversial clause stated that a person who by means of a licensed telecommunication system sends a message that he or she knows to be false for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another person commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding Sh50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both.Unflattering postGeoffrey Andare, who was charged with misuse of a communication device after he wrote an unflattering post about his MP on Facebook, had the law on his side.In her judgement, High Court Judge Mumbi Ngugi said the section was unconstitutional for being too sweeping and subjective.The country has also been urged to enact the Data Protection Bill 2015 to strengthen the rights of digital consumers. The Bill prescribes stiff penalties for corporates that breach users&rsquo; digital privacy.&ldquo;A person who interferes with personal data or infringes on the right of a person to privacy commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding Sh100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both,&rdquo; states the proposed law in part.This implies that service providers like supermarkets, mobile service providers and healthcare institutions will be compelled to handle their users&rsquo; data more carefully, and risk prosecution if they pass this data to third parties.fsunday@standardmedia.co.ke&nbsp;
