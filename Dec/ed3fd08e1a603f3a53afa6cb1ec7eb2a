The time is ripe for the Government to curb the menace of more young people becoming trapped in perpetual unemployment.Analysis of this country&rsquo;s unemployment figures for the youth, through baseline survey from NGOs, has consistently indicated that the number of youths trapped in unending unemployment has doubled in the past two years. It can be explained by the process of creaming and parking, where youth with the highest qualifications and skills are being &ldquo;creamed&rdquo; off by employers, keeping unemployment as a whole relatively stable while, those who are the least employable and most vulnerable are being &ldquo;parked&rdquo; in the dole queue. Sadly, the vast majority of young people are being forced to scale down their aspirations as a result of the current economic situation being experienced.Our overcrowded job market is forcing thousands of graduates into unemployment or less-skilled jobs. In turn, those with less skills and qualifications are settling down into unskilled work, and unskilled workers are left unemployed.It is like a game of musical chairs, where there are far too few places to sit down when the music stops.

They fear that they will never find work or be able to support themselves, let alone a family of their own.Many of them are branded as &ldquo;unemployable&rdquo; before they are even given a chance.And all too often they face a long and downward spiral towards poverty, hopelessness, terrorism or worse.The Government should act, not only to turn their lives around, but to improve the lives of other young people.There is living proof that, where opportunities are made available, it is possible to give them the skills and self-esteem they need to get past the dole queue and shape their future. Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan&rsquo;s former prime minister who succumbed to terrorism in 2007, remarked that&nbsp; extremism, militancy, terrorism and dictatorship feed off one another in an environment of poverty, hopelessness and economic disparity among social classes and particularly the youth.Therefore, creation of systems that permit the youth to rise beyond the social and economic status of their parents remains sacrosanct to stop things like potential terrorists for instance.

The youth are a small percentage of the decision-makers of the present but they are over 60 per cent of the future.Their participation in the analysis and decision making process is critical for this country&rsquo;s sustainable development.Fortunately, that has never been the case. But we have a few African-inspired models that can be adopted.
