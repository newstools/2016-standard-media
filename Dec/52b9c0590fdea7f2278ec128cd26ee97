Farmers whose lands were acquired for construction of Thiba Dam in Kirinyaga County have demanded compensation. The 100 farmers have given the Government up to the end of this month to pay them Sh124 million or return their tittle deeds. The farmers whose part of lands were acquired for the project now claim they cannot secure loans without the vital document or even sell the remaining land. Led by their spokesperson Julian Wakabari, the farmers yesterday said President Uhuru Kenyatta, had during his visit last month, directed the concerned authority to ensure they are paid promptly. The National Irrigation Board (NIB) is said to have acquired the title deeds in 2012 to facilitate for the partial acquisition of the lands next to the proposed mega dam.
