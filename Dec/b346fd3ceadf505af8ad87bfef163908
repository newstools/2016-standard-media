Members of County Assembly have decried the high number of underutilised health centres that were either constructed through CDF or by the county government.&nbsp;According to Biashara Ward MCA Joel Karuri, it is disheartening to see buildings lying idle despite the huge amount of cash used to put them up. He said his ward has three fully constructed health centres, (one which is also equipped) but no staff to man them.&ldquo;There is a shortage of staff and it is time we employed more so that we can open up all health centres,&rdquo; he said.His sentiments were echoed by his Lakeview counterpart Simon Wanyoike who said his ward has two such facilities, one of which was constructed two years ago and to date no personnel has been posted.
