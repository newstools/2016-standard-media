Kirinyaga Residents are in a mourning mood following the death of Dr Stephen Njiru, a prominent lawyer from the county. Led by their Governor Joseph Ndathi, the residents recalled how the lawyer played an important role towards the termination of the ICC cases that faced President Uhuru Kenyatta at The Hague. &#39;&#39;Dr Njiru was one of the lawyers who represented president Uhuru Kenyatta at the Hague and his loss is not only felt by us the residents of this area but the country at large,&quot; the governor said. In a message of condolence to the deceased&#39;s family, Ndathi said Njiru played a big role in the election of president Uhuru in 2013 having been in the team that brought together TNA and URP parties to form a winning team. He was also instrumental in the formation of the Jubilee Party. &#39;&#39;The country has lost a towering lawyer and as a county we have lost a great professional and an ambassador&#39;&#39; Ndathi&#39;s message went on.
