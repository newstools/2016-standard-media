Battle for Trans Nzoia has intensified with the Opposition and Jubilee Party (JP) gearing up for the area&rsquo;s 200,000 votes.Ford Kenya (FK) leadership which is dominant and popular in the region has also vowed to tighten their vigil on the vital bloc. Women Rep Janet Nangabo had last week triggered a political storm when she launched JP campaigns prompting FK leadership to rush in a bid to counter penetration into their stronghold. Nangabo, who is also a member of JP Presidential Campaign and gubernatorial aspirant Joel Gesuka have over the past week held a series of rallies in the county to signal their presence and popularise their agenda of ensuring President Uhuru Kenyatta is re-elected in 2017. Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi, who is also FK branch chairman held a daylong meeting with branch officials to map out strategies to counter the entry of JP in the county. Addressing journalists outside the party offices in Kitale, Wanyonyi said the party is not scared by the entry of JP in the area arguing that campaigns to popularise the party have nothing tangible and worth appreciation to bring to the public.&ldquo;As a party we are not scared of efforts by JP to penetrate the area which is our stronghold. We have energized our supporters and we are ready for a tough fight to retain our glory and we will have what is in our hands intact and even increased because our reform agenda is what Kenya is need of,&rdquo; Wanyonyi declared.Wanyonyi disclosed the party has lined up a series of campaign rallies to strengthen its support in the county as it targets to capture all elective seats especially MCA slots held by JP affiliate parties.They also intend to conduct a membership registration exercise to ensure the party remains intact and urged residents to ignore calls by JP leadership to abandon the party.&ldquo;We have planned to kick off membership registration campaigns and we want to ensure our party commands popularity in the county,&rdquo; he added.The women representative who was elected on a New Ford Kenya ticket has been under pressure from FK leadership to quit JP and join the Opposition ahead of the party primaries but has stood firm saying Jubilee&rsquo;s reelection is sure and just a matter of time.
