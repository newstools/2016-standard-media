Hundreds of Likoni residents are celebrating after piped water was connected to their homes on credit. Mejumaa Juma, a resident of Maweni village in Shikadabu, Likoni sub-county, said her home was connected two weeks ago under the Water and Sanitation for Urban Poor (WSUP) programme. According to her, she paid Sh1,500 and would clear the remaining Sh9,000 in 12 months installments. Another resident Hamisi Swaleh Magongo said the programme has transformed lives since many villagers now have clean water. &quot;We have not even started paying the Sh9,000 but it is clear to everyone that our lives have changed,&quot; he said. Also connected under the programme is the Shikadabu location chief Mwalimu Athman who co-ordinated the residents to get access to clean water. Mombasa County Government and Mombasa Water and Sanitation Company (Mowassco) have partnered with WSUP, Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP) of the World Bank and Videns Evides International to run the programme. WSUP Project Officer Emily Kirigha said they had embarked on the first phase of the programme in Likoni. &quot;This project presents a unique opportunity in the area and is intended to achieve universal water connection covering the urban poor as well,&quot; Ms Kirigha said. Mowassco&#39;s Marketing and Liaison Officer Jennifer Munyori said the arrangement was in line with a policy that seeks to provide low income residents with clean water in the entire county. Mowassco Likoni Manager Beatrice Nyamwamu said apart from the water connection to low income earners, the water company has established water kiosks that would sell water at subsidised prices.
