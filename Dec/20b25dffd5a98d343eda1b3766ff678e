Political aspirants in Laikipia County have disowned the selection of Nakuru County Assembly Speaker Susan Kihika to head President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s 2017 campaigns.The aspirants who gathered at Vineyard Hotel in Nanyuki town demanded the appointment of representatives from Laikipia to sit on the national presidential campaign team.The aspirants, led by John Wakaba, John Mwaniki and Wachira Gituku, accused Jubilee Party of sidelining the region in the picking of Uhuru&#39;s campaign team. They said the region had the capacity to deliver almost 300,000 votes to Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto in next year&#39;s elections. &quot;We want to make it very clear that we are not happy as a county. We support President Kenyatta and his deputy Ruto and we voted for them overwhelmingly in 2013, but we were left out of the national presidential campaign team,&quot; said Mr Wakaba.The election hopefuls now want the team reconstituted.&quot;We want the JP team to go back to the drawing board and appoint a representative from Laikipia who will be communicating the party&#39;s affairs to us. We have declared that we will not recognise Kihika or even take instructions regarding the party from her,&quot; said Wakaba.The leaders protested against the cancellation of another meeting Kihika had called. They described Kihika&#39;s move as demeaning to the county.&quot;We are a county that is politically mature and we will not allow anyone from outside to arm-twist us,&quot; said Samuel Kabuchwa, who is eyeing the senator&#39;s seat.
