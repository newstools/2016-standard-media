Out of 10 teachers, one or two are bad and cannot be allowed to spoil the lives of our kids,&rdquo; said Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i. Kenya National Examinations Council Chairman George Magoha, said the country cannot deny that the education sector and exams face challenges.&ldquo;Teachers&rsquo; performance and need for TSC to punish the teachers who are crooks cannot be overemphasised,&rdquo; said Prof Magoha, who also wondered why teachers should be posted to schools in their rural homes.RESTORED RESPECT ALSO READ: Matiang'i vindicated as tough rules lock out exam cheatsA total of 577,000 candidates sat this year&rsquo;s KCSE, out of which 88,929 scored between and A and C+. Dr Matiang&rsquo;i said all of them will be absorbed in public universities.TSC CEO Nancy Macharia said the measures put in place by the ministry and the commission had restored respect and credibility in the country&rsquo;s education system.&ldquo;We have wasted generations; literally murdered our own country through exam cheating. We have many educated young graduates without critical and analytical skills,&rdquo; said Ms Macharia.She said TSC will strive to ensure that teachers inculcate values of honesty, integrity, transparency and hard work in students.&ldquo;If we select the wrong people to study medicine, teaching, engineering, law, accounts, among others then we will most likely end up with doctors, teachers, engineers, lawyers and accountants who have no professional integrity and ethics,&rdquo; she added.Matiang&rsquo;i said the centralisation of exam marking centres and the hiring of more professional to manage exams was key to the reduction of exam malpractices.Speaking at Shimo La Tewa Secondary in Mombasa, Matian&rsquo;gi said 74,810 professionals were hired to mark KCSE exams.
