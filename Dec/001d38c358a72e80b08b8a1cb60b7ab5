Others are on the run but we will make sure they are brought to book&quot;, he said.As the coffee harvesting season in the country unfolds, farmers of the crop are a wary lot, especially after growing incidences of theft reported in the recent past.Coffee farmers have been victims of brazen attacks that have seen armed robbers breach perimeter walls and fences, making away with bags of coffee worth millions of shillings, and leaving death and destruction in their wake.Most of the coffee targeted by the gangs is the unmilled premium grade P1, P2 and AA.&nbsp;This year alone, over 1,000 bags of the crop have been whisked away from coffee factories in Mt Kenya region, with Nyeri County being the hardest hit.But, despite numerous such incidents occurring in the region over the past two years, security agencies have been unable to solve the mystery of where the stolen coffee was hidden.

They are the only ones who have the requisite permits to transport coffee without raising suspicion.It is not yet clear when or where the coffee parchment netted yesterday was stolen. Residents living near the house where it was discovered suggested that the most recent consignment could have been delivered on Friday.&quot;We usually hear a lot of lorries coming and going especially at night but we always thought it was timber or cement for the construction being delivered,&quot; said one neighbour.Police are investigating the possibility that the suspect was using his firewood business as a cover for coffee theft operations.
