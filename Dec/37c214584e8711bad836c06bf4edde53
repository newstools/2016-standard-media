A man was arrested by county enforcement officers for trying to steal computers from the county&#39;s revenue department. This came a few weeks after computers were stolen from the procurement office. County head of security Jacob Sohera said the suspect was caught while trying to sneak out with two computers. He said the suspect was handed to police officers and will help them during investigations. &quot;I appreciate the security officers for arresting the suspect. He is from Busia and somebody must have directed him to the office and he will help us with investigations to arrest his accomplice,&quot; Mr Sohera said. He linked the suspect to the earlier robbery, saying according to a CID investigation, the suspects were from Busia.
