Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda has accused his political detractors of using underhand tactics to derail his political career. This is after leaflets suggesting he was out to make CORD leader Raila Odinga lose the 2017 elections were found scattered along Bondo-Usenge highway yesterday morning. The legislator distanced himself from the leaflets. The leaflets insinuated that Ochanda had organised a meeting between a disgruntled sub-clan from Sakwa and Yimbo clan at Wambasa Secondary School on Jamhuri Day to ensure Raila is not elected president in 2017. &quot;This is the work of cowards. If they are very sure of what they are saying, why don&#39;t they come out and tell the public?&quot; he posed.

In July, leaflets demanding that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission investigates and arrests Ochanda for misappropriating CDF monies were found scattered on the streets of Bondo. The leaflets stated how the CDF committee misused public funds in feeding programmes in all 140 primary schools in the constituency. He has, however, termed the intention as malicious and character assassination. &quot;The dirty tactics employed by my enemies to smear my name and the names of other ODM MPs viewed as rebels is a threat to party unity and could affect voter turnout in the next General Election,&quot; said Ochanda. In remarks seemingly aimed at a nominated MP, Ochanda said some people think they are close to Raila and everybody else is an enemy. The MP also took a swipe at those criticising his development record, saying he has done much for the people of Bondo. ALSO READ: Unseating incumbents in Africa calls for planning
