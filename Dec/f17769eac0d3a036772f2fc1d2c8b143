The Kenya National Commission of Human Rights (KNCHR) wants the Senate to suspend debate on electoral laws amendments passed by Jubilee MPs last Thursday. The watchdog says that will allow the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee to review contested sections of the laws. Senate Speaker Ekwe Ethuro has convened a special sitting next week to discuss the matter.&nbsp;KNCHR vice chair George Morara called on the Senate to allow broader consensus on the controversial laws. &ldquo;In the event the Senate passes the Bill, we join the Catholic bishops in calling on the President not to sign it into law,&rdquo; said Morara.KNCHR also condemned what they termed as unwarranted attack on the Presiding Judge of the Judicial Review Division of the High Court Justice George Odunga by Majority Leader Aden Duale.&nbsp;
