The standoff between Jubilee and CORD continued to cause disquiet across the country with&nbsp; the electoral body warning that it could hamper preparations for next year&rsquo;s General Election.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) warned that it was already behind schedule in meeting key electoral&nbsp;timelines, and asked political players tone down the rhetoric before it is &ldquo;too late&rdquo;. For instance, IEBC was supposed to conduct an audit of the voter register and procure equipment by December but these critical deadlines have not been met.&nbsp;A Sh2.5 billion tender to print ballot papers &nbsp; has also stalled after CORD challenged the process in court.Leaders across the country, and even those within the IEBC, say these events could create tensions.

IEBC raised important issues on the recently-enacted laws that must be addressed in good time so that all players know the rules of the game. Jubilee and CORD should sit together and resolve the matters before it is too late,&rdquo; said IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba.&nbsp;Mr Chiloba, however, maintained the commission was committed to delivering free and credible polls next year.IEBC has scheduled its second mass voter listing targeting at least six&nbsp;million new voters to run between January 16 and February 15, 2017. But this could be affected should the Opposition begin streets to protest starting January 4. CORD has threatened to mobilise its supporters to demonstrate over changes to the Election laws passed by Jubilee MPs under controversial circumstances, in reference to Thursday&rsquo;s acrimonious passage of amendments to the Elections Act by Jubilee MPs. CORD legislators boycotted the special session.Religious organisations and civil society groups have also called for a bipartisan approach to resolve the stand-off, with President Uhuru Kenyatta being urged not to assent the amendments by MPs.They questioned why Jubilee MPs were so determinedly to amend the law despite acrimony witnessed on Thursday.&ldquo;We call upon Uhuru to rise above politics and act in his capacity as the President and as a symbol of national unity,&rdquo; said Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops, chairman Cornelius Korir.&ldquo;We wish to remind MPs who are in support of the changes that this goes against the spirit of the jointly negotiated electoral reforms which were arrived at in August 2016 through the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee,&rdquo; added Korir.

There is a problem and we have to be brave and face it,&rdquo; he said during a press briefing.However, opposition leaders said the President&rsquo;s intervention was required.Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi urged Uhuru to ensure the country holds a credible election.Mudavadi warned that once Kenyans lose faith in elections, they may resort to violence.&ldquo;I plead with President Kenyatta not abdicate his principal responsibility of ensuring that we have credible elections,&rdquo; said Mudavadi.National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) chairman Francis ole Kaparo said the country needed dialogue to avert violence.

The end result of all this is rigging of the 2017 polls. It behoves all Kenyans of goodwill to rally behind us in opposing this draconian move,&rdquo; Salat said.&nbsp;
