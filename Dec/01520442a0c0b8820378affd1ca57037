Details have emerged on the intrigues that played out in the interviewing and final shortlisting of 11 names from whom the President will, by law, pick the chairman and six commissioners to replace the outgoing team led Issack Hassan.It also emerged that because of constitutional provisions to ensure regional balance in public bodies, the President may most likely pick lawyer Tukero ole Kina to be the chairperson of the electoral body and not the only other nominee, Wafula Chebukati. This is because the second nominee comes from the same county and community as the Chief Executive Officer of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Ezra Chiloba.If Chebukati is picked, then it may mean that Chiloba would have to be somehow quietly removed to ensure the IEBC leadership reflects the face of Kenya through regional balance in power distribution.The President received the list of the two nominees for chairperson and nine for the commission members on December 21 and given that the Constitution gives him seven days, excluding public holidays, to pick one for the top job and six as commissioners, he is expected to name the new team latest on January 1, 2017.

Coming third was Abdi Yakub Guliye from Egerton University followed by Henry Kizito Okelo Nyongesa, also an IT expert.Fifth was Samuel Kimeu from Transparency International followed by Paul Kibiwott Kurgat, recently replaced as Kenya&#39;s ambassador to Moscow. Kurgat will be counting on the fact that he is the only interviewee to make it to the final list from the Rift Valley because regional balance is a key criteria the President is obliged by law to ensure.Coming seventh was Boya Molu who previously worked with the Judiciary. Consolata Nkatha Bucha Maina and Margaret Mwanchanya tied in eighth position. Given the two-thirds gender rule, at least two of the seven appointees must be women.The panel chaired by Bernadette Musundi was also said to have frowned on the claims made against Ms Mwangangi by the International Policy Group, chaired by Kenneth Otieno, that she pocketed millions of shillings through suspect claims for allowances while a member of the JSC. The group drew the attention of the panel to the fact that the Parliamentary Accounts Committee had recommended that she, together with all the other JSC members then, should be surcharged.

I am a person of integrity. I have never been paid or even have an iota of being paid for a sitting I did not attend,&quot;&nbsp;Mwangangi told panel in self-defence during her interview.&quot;I have not even at one time been called by Parliament or investigative agencies, including the EACC, to answer to such financial queries in the JSC.&quot;INTEGRITY ISSUESHowever, no integrity issues were raised by way of petition to the panel on Kina, Wafula and Naikuni. But it is reported that some of the panelists were concerned by the behind-the-scenes lobbying for Naikuni by another top Jubilee politician, and like in the case of Taib, doubt was cast on his independence if picked.In terms of performance during the interview, Naikuni did well but Kina was ranked the highest with 13 percentage points ahead of Wafula. The panel was reportedly impressed by Kina&#39;s professional standing and absence of evidence of political engagement either with Jubilee or the Opposition.The panel was composed of lawyers Evans Monari and Mary Karen Kigen for Jubilee while former judge Tom Mbaluto and Ogla Chepkemboi Karani represented the interests of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy.
