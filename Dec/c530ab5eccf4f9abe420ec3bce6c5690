Pay TV provider, Zuku, is in a new push to increase subscriber numbers after it entered a partnership with UK firm, Azuri.The two firms are bringing to the market a bundled kit that includes a solar-powered television set, solar panels as well as access to satellite TV. Customers will pay Sh149 per day for the service over a two-year period, which will in part be repayment for the kit as well as TV services. Azuri Chief Executive&nbsp;Simon Bransfield-Garth said the firm saw a gap in the country where it has been selling solar lighting solutions to rural households for five years now.&ldquo;We have discovered that we could provide solar power on a &lsquo;pay as you go&rsquo; basis for less money that people were spending on kerosene and money spent on charging mobile phones,&rdquo; he said on Wednesday in Nairobi.At Sh149 a day, the total cost over two years would translate to about Sh108,000. The firm does not have the option for a one-off payment for the kit. The daily payments will be through mobile money. ALSO READ: Woman loses battle for 935 acres as farmers' group declared owner
