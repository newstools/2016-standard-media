&nbsp; Two brothers drowned while swimming in the ocean. Kea Panuel, 11, and Esau Panuel, 9, both pupils at Kilifi Primary School, went missing on Sunday only for their bodies to be discovered on Tuesday morning after a frantic 72-hour search. The search was spearheaded by Kilifi County Sea Rescue Team. An officer in charge of the rescue team Caleb Otieno said the team received information about the disappearance of the children at 10pm on Sunday and deployed a rescue team. He warned visitors at the beaches not to ignore safety instructions and drift to dangerous swimming zones. He appealed to parents to take care of their children at this time when beaches are crowded.
