The problem with Kenya isn&rsquo;t her patriotic people. Kenya&rsquo;s most intractable affliction is caused by a tiny but viciously malicious and highly deceptive group of charlatans who use acres of space in newspapers to parrot their unrefined and tainted &ldquo;commentaries&rdquo; on irrelevant pursuits in order to mislead the people and keep them captive to the merchants of impunity. Makau Mutua published an incoherent verbiage titled, &ldquo;Miguna Miguna&rsquo;s personal demons come out to haunt him&rdquo; in which he hurled profanities at me for daring to deconstruct my putative political opponents on live TV debates to which they had voluntarily participated &mdash; not as women or men &mdash; but as &ldquo;aspirants for public office.&rdquo; Makau is a notorious intellectual quack that deserves some deconstruction. Makau&rsquo;s dubious record and longevity at the Kenya Human Rights Commission only rivals that of Gaus Julius Caesar of Rome. Ironclad evidence depicts Makau as the KHRC Chairman into perpetuity who practises nepotism and dips his hands in the &ldquo;humanitarian&rdquo; till to feather his pockets. In 2002, Makau served briefly as one of Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s chief sycophants in pursuit of a coveted position as head of the ill-fated &ldquo;Truth and Reconciliation&rdquo; process. However, as soon as Kibaki declined to appoint him due to his political debauchery, Makau metamorphosed into a Kibaki &ldquo;critic.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Let's lift politics out of the mud Between 2007 and 2008, Makau magically transformed into a Kalonzo Musyoka puppeteer. In successive fawning articles, he praised Kalonzo, his tribesman, as the &ldquo;best presidential candidate for Kenya&rdquo; and called Raila Odinga &ldquo;unelectable.&rdquo; Ironically, he wasn&rsquo;t doing this genuinely for a fellow kinsman; Makau was being a typical dissembler: he was opportunistically pretending to be a Kalonzo loyalist with the hope of an appointment in case Kalonzo became president. Typical of such a political chameleon, Makau quickly became a Raila sycophant as soon as Mr Odinga was named Prime Minister in 2008. But because Makau knew that his degenerate hypocrisy wouldn&rsquo;t have taken him far as long as I was Raila&rsquo;s senior adviser, he turned me into his punching bag. He conveniently overlooked the fact that he had called Mr Odinga &ldquo;Idi Amin&rdquo; in his column of 5/6/2007. The mediocre and sanctimonious chatterers like Makau obsessively focus on discussing people in order to divert the attention of Kenyans from debating concrete national issues such as the run-away plunder and theft of public resources by organised cartels; drug trafficking; dilapidated infrastructure; and extremely high and unsustainable unemployment. For a &ldquo;scholar&rdquo; and self-proclaimed &ldquo;human rights activist,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s illuminating that Makau has never penned an article on numerous Auditor General&rsquo;s reports showing that elected officials like governors have been involved in unprecedented looting of billions of public funds. Not a whiff about the massive theft of public resources and the extra-judicial killings has found itself in the retrograde professor&rsquo;s Tweets and petty articles. Instead the short bald man with an unprecedented low self-esteem uses American colloquialism to demonstrate his unmanly fetish on me. ALSO READ: Let&rsquo;s all speak against gender-bashing in Kenya Mutua states that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;a very tall dark-skinned black man&rdquo; as if that is a scary thing. He juxtaposes my hefty genuine African physique and organic intellect with his &ldquo;very light-skin&rdquo; empty bald head and short constitution &mdash; and typical of &ldquo;Oreo Cookies&rdquo; &mdash; Makau frets about my physical appearance as some women do over their co-wives. He has demanded that I be banned from running for the position of Governor for Nairobi purely based on his envy of my integrity, vision and courage &mdash; character traits he would like to have but which he blames me for not having. Why would a &ldquo;distinguished professor&rdquo; spend so much time and use so many words to pillory &ldquo;an unelectable fragile person?&rdquo; Makau knows that malicious propaganda is not a substitute for the truth, facts or logic. Once upon a time Makau repeatedly predicted that Uhuru Kenyatta would never become president of Kenya. He swore on his dysfunctional crystal ball that both Mr Kenyatta and William Ruto would be convicted and jailed at The Hague. It was quacks like Makau who used their inferiority complex and morbid obsession with me to convince Mr Odinga in 2011 to ignore my prescient warnings about the IEBC&rsquo;s irredeemable incompetence and malleability. With such legendary predictions, I&rsquo;m happy with Makau&rsquo;s assertion that I&rsquo;m unelectable! Make no mistake: I pose the greatest challenge to the cartels and their surrogates. The charlatans know that, hence their desperate panic. Let that stubborn fact grind Makau&rsquo;s fake intellectual and ethical innards. As El Commandante Fidel Castro once quipped, &ldquo;History will absolve me.&rdquo;
