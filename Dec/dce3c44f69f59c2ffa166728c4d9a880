Leaders have cautioned the Maasai and Kipsigis communities in Olposumoru area, Narok North, over political incitement. The area was affected by skirmishes on the eve of Christmas last year where scores lost their lives and over 200 houses were torched. The chaos arose after a herder was allegedly shot dead in the Olposumoru forest. Governor Samuel ole Tunai, Narok East MP Lemanken Aramat and area MCA, who is also House Leader of Majority Wilson Masikonde, have hailed the new-found peace and coexistence among the two communities. &quot;We were taken aback by the clashes that happened here last year and I am glad you (communities), leaders and the Government met and resolved the matter.We do not want to go back there again.We need peace for development,&quot; said Tunai. He urged the locals to shun tribal and divisive politics that threatens peace in the area, saying since peace prevailed, various development projects such as the road network had improved. A spot-check by The Standard revealed most of the houses razed down during the skirmishes have since been rebuilt.
