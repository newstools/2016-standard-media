For the first time in decades the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam results were released from a venue outside Nairobi.And for the first time, the results were released the same year the examination was written. Results for last year&rsquo;s KCSE were released in March this year.According to Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang, the results were unveiled yesterday, one day short of &ldquo;exactly one month when the last examination was completed&rdquo;.Those at Shimo la Tewa Secondary School were exuberant, after it was revealed that Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i was to arrive at the institution to unveil the&nbsp;exam results. Security was beefed up as guests began to arrive.

Reports indicate that the officials were not invited to the function in advance.At the end of the speeches and in spite of the CS and Magoha&rsquo;s withering speeches, the crowd at the school&rsquo;s hall erupted in loud applause, partly out of shock, awe and happiness separately or in combination.

Officials openly gasped or cupped their faces in anticipation as the CS delivered his remarks.The function ended within 80 minutes, a marked departure from the annual ritual which used to take hours at the Education ministry headquarters in Nairobi.Despite the &ldquo;shock&rdquo; results&rdquo; indicating a dramatic reduction in As, the crowd erupted in applause and mobbed the CS and Magoha at the end of their speeches.
