NAIROBI: The school uniform must be the same for all learners regardless of religion and status, the High Court has ruled.The court ruled that headteachers and management boards prescribed uniforms they believe play a big role in &ldquo;securing high and improving school standards&rdquo;. High Court judge Anyara Emukule said students cannot have different attire for school uniform, saying this encourages religious and status divisions.This verdict was read this week in a case where a parent challenged her daughter&rsquo;s suspension from Bura Girls High School, Taita Taveta County, over alleged boycott of Sunday mass and wearing Hijab.The judge ruled that school Boards of Management shall dictate what students should wear.

A standardised approach in schools with such mundane things as uniforms would maintain a common identity among all students, irrespective of the origin of a particular student or his or her religious affiliation or faith,&rdquo; Justice Emukule ruled.SuspendedThe complaint before the court was that 38 girls were suspended from school for refusing to attend Sunday mass on June 21 last year.The petitioner, named ABH, explained that her daughter, together with others, hid in a classroom to avoid being forced to attend a Christian service during the Ramadhan.She added that the suspension was not just about the Sunday service mass, but was a buildup of a disagreement over wearing Hijab during prayer times and fast.

ALSO READ: TSC issues fresh guidelines on teachers&rsquo; casesThe Methodist Church has since appealed the ruling before the Supreme Court, arguing that having preferential treatment in schools would amount to discriminating against others and would encourage defiance against schools rules.The Teachers Service Commission (TSC), which is enjoined in the Fuchiga case as a respondent, argues that the only way to resolve the uniform and religion issue is through an Education Ministry policy.The case will be heard on January 11, 2017.
