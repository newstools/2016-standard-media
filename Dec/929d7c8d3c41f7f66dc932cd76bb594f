What should I do to ensure I don&rsquo;t buy land that has been blacklisted because the title was fraudulently acquired? Can the reports by commissions of inquiry set up by previous regimes help in resolving the confusion and uncertainties? Paul, Mombasa.There have been three main commissions of inquiry on land matters: The Parliamentary Committee on the Coastal land Problems (1966) and Njonjo Land Commission on Land Law System of Kenya and the Commission of Inquiry into Illegal and Irregular Allocations of Public Land, popularly known as the Ndungu Land Report. The Ndungu report made several recommendations, including naming of beneficiaries of illegal and irregularly acquired property but has since been swept under the carpet.Property lawyers have in the past cautioned clients against dealing in the blacklisted property even if official searches confirmed them as registered owners.The legal reality is that there would be no compensation to property owners who acquired their investments illegally or irregularly.
