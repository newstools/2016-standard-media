Opposition leaders yesterday gave the proposed National Super Alliance fresh momentum when they presented a united front to face President Uhuru Kenyatta in next year&rsquo;s polls. CORD leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka together with Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi endorsed the alliance, terming it the vehicle to defeat Jubilee in the next General Election. The leaders declared that the die was already cast to send Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto home through the combined efforts of opposition parties. Speaking yesterday during the Wiper Party&#39;s National Delegates Conference in Kasarani, the leaders warned against pulling out of the International Criminal Court (ICC), stating that the Opposition will resist such attempts. President Uhuru in his Jamhuri Day address to the nation said that the country was still considering pulling out of the Rome Statute.

He was allowed to run for presidency. He was also allowed to attend the hearings while serving as the President. Other leaders who have been taken to the courts have been locked in the cells unlike him who was given freedom,&quot; Raila said &quot;Kenya will remain in ICC whether the President likes it or not,&quot;&nbsp; he added. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was endorsed as Wiper&#39;s presidential candidate and took the opportunity to pitch for his candidature as CORD&#39;s best bet to defeat Uhuru. &quot;We have to agree on a candidate who is acceptable across the country and who would vanquish Jubilee,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not want to be called a watermelon again. It used to be said that I can&#39;t sacrifice my candidature, but I have proved that wrong. I&#39;m not saying that I can&#39;t sacrifice anymore but we cannot stop what God has purposed,&quot; he said. Raila took a swipe at Uhuru over claims that foreign countries were funding some civil organizations to manipulate the electoral process, describing them as a sign the Jubilee administration had panicked over an opposition alliance. He warned his opposition colleagues to remain steadfast in the unity saying it was the only way to send Jubilee home.

When they rigged elections in 2013, they thought we would be separated before next year&#39;s polls,&quot; he said. &quot;Jubilee has panicked of losing the elections and they have started making claims of civil groups working against them,&quot; he added. Mudavadi on his part said the leader&#39;s presence in the function was a sign that opposition parties can work together. &quot;We have a huge responsibility of removing Jubilee and for us to win we must work together,&quot; said the Amani leader. The Opposition leaders warned that they will accept nothing short of a free and fair election. &quot;We also want to make it clear that we will not accept anything less than a free and credible polls,&quot; Raila added. The leaders chided Uhuru, claiming that he had sensed defeat in the fourth coming elections, declaring that the Jubilee administration would be the first one term administration in the country&#39;s history.

Each has been separately campaigning for their candidature. Raila and Mudavadi had announced that the supper alliance would be launched in February ahead of the polls, even as picking its presidential candidate threatens to be the Opposition&#39;s main challenge.
