Did Kanye West&rsquo;s home renovation help push him over the edge? That was a screaming headline by Realtor.com. Showbiz circles have been awash with Kanye West&rsquo;s apparent breakdown that&nbsp; came after a number of bizarre acts, and utterances. Last month, he cancelled his tour and was taken to hospital suffering from what has been described as extreme paranoia. Social media has had a field day with this, with everyone speculating about what would have pushed the artiste over the edge.Well, Realtor.com thinks an unending home renovation should be thrown into the equation. Or &ldquo;the seemingly never-ending renovation of his mansion in Hidden Hills, CA, with Kim Kardashian.&rdquo; The article quotes another in the San Jose Mercury News: &ldquo;Anyone who has undertaken a home remodel knows that this kind of domestic upheaval can be a major cause of stress to individuals and to couples. So, it&rsquo;s reasonable to wonder if the massive remodel Kanye West and Kim Kardashian have undertaken on their $20 (Sh2 billion) million mansion contributed to the singer&rsquo;s stress.&rdquo;Sample this: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like spiraling home renovation bills to ratchet up your stress levels. And as we all know, more money just means bigger bills.... Sources say the amount spent on this home renovation has already stretched into the range of $10 million (slightly over Sh1 billion).&rdquo;And according to the report, a lot of that money is just going down the drain: &ldquo;Reports have surfaced that West has been fickle about decisions, ordering renovations one day that he then tells them to rip out the next.&rdquo; &ldquo;Kanye walked into the house, decided he hated all the furniture brought in by [Gallin], and demanded it be returned to the vendors,&rdquo; a source told the New York Post. &ldquo;But they refused to take it back, so he took it all out and threw it into storage. He then spent a fortune on a new set of furniture.&rdquo; Then the twist of relationship woes, Realtor.com opines: &ldquo;No two partners ever totally see eye to eye on home renovations, so it&rsquo;s probably no surprise that the House of Kimye (Kim and Kanye) is undergoing some strain. During the final taping of sister Khloe&rsquo;s talk show, Kim complained she had been footing the entire renovation bill herself (and that&rsquo;s when the total was only $8 million).&rdquo;
