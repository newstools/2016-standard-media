All is not well in President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee house as Members of Parliament allied to Deputy President William Ruto exchange barbs in public. State House Political Advisor Joshua Kuttuny, a governor and three MPs hit at Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Majority Leader in the National Assembly Aden Duale over public remarks against their opponents. Kuttuny, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) cautioned Duale to keep off the region and focus on North Eastern counties, claiming that &lsquo;he is dividing the electorate&rsquo;. The leaders noted that negative remarks against fellow leaders in the vote-rich North and South Rift regions, only polarises residents, which in turn makes the party lose popularity. Speaking in Kalenjin dialect, Kuttuny said, &ldquo;There are some &lsquo;wild dogs&rsquo; that every time they open their mouths to speak, they hit out at other leaders who are thought to be out of the Jubilee fold,&rdquo; said the former Cherangany MP.

Governor Jackson Mandago on his part called on leaders to engage in constructive politics over constant verbal attacks. &ldquo;We are planning discussions with Baringo Senator Gideon Moi of Kanu and Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto to convince them to join us in the Jubilee Party,&rdquo; Mandago said.
