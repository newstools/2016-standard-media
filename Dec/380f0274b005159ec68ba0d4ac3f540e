Former Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu has dismissed Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua as a &#39;political suicide bomber&#39;. Ngilu said the governor knows his time is up and wants to politically perish with everyone else in Ukambani. The former CS, Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr and Eastern African Legislative Assembly&#39;s Peter Mathuki, separately termed &#39;careless&#39; Dr Mutua&#39;s bid to link Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to land grabbing in Machakos County. Ngilu likened the governor to a &#39;political baby&#39; who knows nothing about decorum and respect to elders and seniors. &quot;This man called Mutua should respect Kalonzo and recognise him as the Ukambani political kingmaker. He should grow up politically and learn to respect his seniors who preceded him in leadership,&quot; Ngilu said.

Mr Mathuki said Mutua&#39;s careless utterances on Kalonzo amounted to contempt and disrespect.
