Making more money is the major goal for majority of Kenyans in the new year.Considering the hard economic times that many have been forced to face in 2016 that saw fewer of them travel upcountry for the holidays, money has been cited as the major saviour for majority of them. The 54 per cent majority have indicated their new plans to ensure they make an extra coin in 2017 through either investing in the right places, avoiding luxuries, or reducing their usual expenses.Surprisingly, even with the current health crisis that has forced many to spend from their own pockets or die silently in their homes, not many Kenyans are interested to give health that extra attention.According to a survey by Ipsos, only 13 per cent of Kenyans plan to improve their physical or health conditions while a mere one per cent want to lead a healthy lifestyle.

Whether this is because they are completely satisfied with their current situation, or rather, have no realistic hope of material, physical or spiritual betterment, is unclear,&quot; read the report.
