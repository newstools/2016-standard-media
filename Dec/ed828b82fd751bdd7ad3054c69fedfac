If that fails, the people of Kenya will have the final say,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula.Accompanied by CORD allied legislators from both Houses of Parliament, Wetang&#39;ula warned that no amount of&nbsp; force or intimidation by the Jubilee side would stop the resolve by the people of Kenya.He said Kenyans will resist any form of oppression and intimidation by a Government that is hell-bent on returning the country to a state of anarchy by forcing an amendment of elections law.&nbsp; ALSO READ:Kenya ready for mobile voting system
