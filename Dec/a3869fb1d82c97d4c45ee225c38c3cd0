The Law Society of Kenya has accused the Government of intimidating and threatening judges handling political cases.LSK President Isaac Okero said lawyers were gravely concerned by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale&#39;s criticism of High Court Judge George Odunga shortly before the latter delivered a judgement in a case in which CORD had challenged Jubilee&#39;s controversial amendments to electoral laws. Jubilee MPs forced the amendments after Opposition MPs walked out of the chambers.In his criticism of Justice Odunga, Mr Duale said he would introduce a motion in Parliament to discuss the judge&#39;s conduct for reasons he did not disclose. &quot;To you judge Odunga, I want to warn you that Parliament has its own calendar. On January 24, I will introduce a motion to discuss you,&quot; he said.Yesterday, Mr Okero told Duale to stop interfering with the Judiciary&#39;s work.

It is conduct completely untenable in any civilised democracy.&quot; Okero said the judge holds an important constitutional office as a judge.
