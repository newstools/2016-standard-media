A Sh4.7 million water project has been launched to supply clean and safe drinking water to Buchenge village in Ainamoi sub-county.The project funded by the East African Breweries Ltd (EABL) Foundation will improve access to clean and safe drinking water. Speaking during the commissioning, Ainamoi MP Benjamin Lang&#39;at urged residents to make use of the new resource to improve their livelihoods. He also praised EABL Foundation for complementing the county&#39;s efforts to provide access to clean and safe water for local communities.&quot;This project will bring relief to the residents of Buchenge who have long suffered the burden of trekking long distances in search of water,&quot; said Mr Langat.Despite being blessed with abundant water resources, Africa still struggles to supply it to&nbsp;people&#39;s doorsteps.The United Nations predicts that nearly 50 per cent of Africa&#39;s population will face water scarcity by 2025. Locally, the Kenya National Water Services Strategy indicates that sustainable access to safe water stands at around 60 per cent in urban centres.EABL Corporate Relations Director Eric Kiniti said the firm was committed to enhancing communities&#39; access to water and basic sanitation.&quot;We understand that access to water and sanitation is critical to sustainable development,&quot; he said.The firm has invested in the installation and management of 73 water and sanitation programmes in Kenya, reaching over 1 million households over the past 10 years.
