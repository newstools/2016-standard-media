Just three years ago, most of the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing economies were in Africa.Among them were Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. A middle class was emerging, led by young, tech-savvy entrepreneurs who bought flashy cars, new houses and the latest smartphones. Africa&rsquo;s impressive average economic growth of around 5 per cent over the 14 years to 2014 saw economists toasting to the continent&rsquo;s development potential.Buoyed primarily by high commodity prices and marginal exposure to global financial markets, the African economy as a whole was largely undisturbed by the 2009 global financial crisis. Steady flows of foreign direct investment assured a sustainable growth trajectory.During that period, China, India, Brazil and European countries scrambled for a slice of Africa&rsquo;s investment opportunities.

Already, Angola, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Uganda &ndash; the African countries that depend most heavily on commodities, such as oil, gold, diamonds, bauxite, rutile, timber and copper &ndash; are in dire straits.Economists also attribute this sudden reversal of fortune to other factors, such as volatile global financial markets, weaknesses in global growth, particularly in China, Brazil and India, rising borrowing costs and severe infrastructure constraints (particularly of electricity supply) in many countries.But it is the plunge in commodity prices that has dealt the most devastating blow.The price of oil plummeted from $100 (Sh10,000 at current rates) a barrel in 2013 to $26 (Sh2,600) a barrel in February 2016, and then back up to around $50 (Sh5,000) currently.

The World Bank reports that in February 2016, &ldquo;copper prices declined by almost a third from their peak in February 2011 to $4,595 [Sh459,500] per tonne.&rdquo;Tsidi Tsikata, who led an International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment mission to Zambia in March this year, has issued a bleak report: &ldquo;The Zambian economy is under intense pressure,&rdquo; he warns, calling for action to regain macroeconomic stability.Losing moneyMore than half of Zambia&rsquo;s copper producers are losing money, and big players in the country have closed shop, with thousands losing their jobs.

African Minerals, a London-registered mines company, used to manage the iron ore mines in Tonkolili, northern Sierra Leone, which are worth over $1 billion (Sh100 billion). Tonkolili has the biggest iron ore deposit in Africa and the third largest in the world.The fall in commodity prices represents a significant shock for the sub-Saharan African region, as fuels, ore and metals account for more than 60 per cent of the region&rsquo;s exports.In 2011, iron ore sold for $191 (Sh19,100) per tonne, but it fell to $45 (Sh4,500) per tonne in June 2016. Iron ore is Sierra Leone&rsquo;s economic lifeline.&ldquo;The iron ore price decline affected macro-financial stability and reversed the country&rsquo;s remarkable positive growth trajectory,&rdquo; said the African Development Bank.Ordinary citizens feel the impact in currency depreciation and rising inflation. The value of Nigeria&rsquo;s naira fell from 150 to 450 naira to the dollar between January 2014 and October 2016. The Sierra Leonean currency faced the same fate, declining to 6,500 leones to the dollar, from 5,000 leones a year ago.Nigeria&rsquo;s currency depreciation means it has lost the right to call itself Africa&rsquo;s largest economy.

The country wants to sell off some of its national assets, including energy and oil corporations.Last March, Sierra Leone announced a 30 per cent cut in recurrent government expenditures, suspended financing for capital projects and the purchase of official furniture, eliminated travel allowances for government officials and began implementing a 50 per cent cut in vehicle maintenance allowance, among other measures.However, Herbert M&rsquo;cleod, a leading Sierra Leonean economist, says, &ldquo;It is bad policies and bad management that have brought us here,&rdquo; and recommends using proceeds from mining to boost jobs creation and power supply and to construct roads, among other things.The Ugandan government has scrapped gasoline and diesel subsidies, suspended construction of new roads, banned non-essential foreign travels and stopped the launch of a new airline. Zambia is cutting subsidies on electricity and agricultural inputs.South Africa, whose largest exports are iron ore, coal, gold and other minerals, is also affected by the fall in commodity prices, and joins Liberia, Gambia and other countries implementing various austerity measures.

It means these countries spend less and can redirect excess funds into critically needed infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and energy. Robust growth in these economies will continue, forecasts the World Bank.Going forward, mitigating efforts will require good financial management and increases in revenue generation locally, experts say.There may yet be a silver lining: experts expect the impact of current belt-tightening policies in Africa to kick in in the medium to long term, providing a cushion for national budgets.Also, countries will learn the lessons of commodity price movements and will be more inclined to continue diversifying their economies. &mdash; Africa Renewal&nbsp;
