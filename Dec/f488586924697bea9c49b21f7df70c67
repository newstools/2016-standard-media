President Uhuru Kenyatta Wednesday pledged that the Government will compensate the families of 11 General Service Unit officers who died in a horrific accident at Karai, Naivasha. The Saturday night incident has so far claimed 43 lives. During the funeral service at State House Wednesday, President Kenyatta promised that the Interior ministry will process the payment by January. It was a sombre mood at State House as families of the 11 GSU officers who died in the accident were joined by senior Government officials. All the officers drawn from the G Company, a branch of the GSU, were attached to State House for VIP protection. The memorial service was presided over by Father Dominic Wamugunda of the Catholic Church. Fr Wamugunda called on Kenyans to emulate the officers in their selfless dedication to the country. The mourners, led by Uhuru, praised the officers for their dedicated service.
