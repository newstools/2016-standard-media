Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) is in the spotlight once again after the case of an intern clinician treating a patient in need of critical care was unearthed.Samson Buluma, an intern at the hospital, has been accused of treating Gladys Kamande who lives with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Ms Kamande has to move around with an oxygen cylinder and a generator which sustains her life by pumping oxygen into her body.Her story gained prominence recently when a young boy begging on the streets of Nairobi saw her with the life-support devices and broke down.This brought an outpouring of support from well-wishers who contributed Sh9.6 million through an online campaign for treatment spearheaded by activist Ndung&rsquo;u Nyoro.
