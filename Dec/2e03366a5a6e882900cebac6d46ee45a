At least 20&nbsp;top&nbsp;private&nbsp;schools&nbsp;risk deregistration for running multiple examination centres to boost results in a bid to attract students. The&nbsp;schools&nbsp;produce best students in national examinations every year. But behind the facade of success lurks a dirty trick &ndash;the institutions admit many students but register candidates in separate examination centres based on their performance. Among the&nbsp;schools&nbsp;fingered for engaging in this act are Makini&nbsp;Schools&nbsp;in Nairobi and Kisumu, Gilgil Hill Academy, Mt Kenya Academy, St Kevin Academy in Mombasa, Lizar Junior Academy in Naivasha and New Light in Komarock, Nairobi. Others are from Nyeri, Kiambu, Uasin Gishu, Nyandarua, Meru and Machakos. Nairobi and Nakuru&nbsp;top&nbsp;the list. Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i warned on Thursday that the&nbsp;schools&nbsp;will be deregistered. Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) chairperson George Magoha termed the practice &lsquo;criminal fraud.&rsquo;&nbsp; READ MORE Top Coast students reveal secrets of success in KCPE Midwife, 71, ready to join Form One despite low marks Little Sun and Shield outshines giants Prof Magoha noted that in some&nbsp;schools, candidates sit in one examination room but have different index numbers and centre codes. &ldquo;The ministry is aware that some&nbsp;private&nbsp;schools&nbsp;operate multiple examination centres with an aim of engaging in unethical practices meant to enable them record favourable rankings in national examinations,&rdquo; Dr Matiang&rsquo;i said while releasing this year&rsquo;s Kenya Certificate Primary Education (KCPE) results on Thursday. &ldquo;The practice must end&nbsp;now. I have instructed Knec to ensure no&nbsp;school&nbsp;registers more than one centre in national examinations,&rdquo; he said, and termed the practice &lsquo;ridiculous&rsquo; saying the&nbsp;schools&nbsp;use innocent pupils in an unscrupulous marketing of their businesses. Education stakeholders yesterday asked the CS to take stern action against the&nbsp;schools. Kenya&nbsp;Private&nbsp;Schools&nbsp;Association (KPSA) Chief Executive Officer Peter Ndoro said the association has for the last four years pleaded with the ministry to crack the whip on such&nbsp;schools. &ldquo;Whether big or small, we want these&nbsp;schools&nbsp;deregistered and closed down because they are not many. We want Matiang&rsquo;i to crack the whip and restore sanity because they are spoilers,&rdquo; Mr Ndoro said. He said there are about 7,000 registered&nbsp;private&nbsp;schools, out of which 6,800 are registered examination centres. &ldquo;Those with bad habits are actually about 20 and we will support Matiang&rsquo;i in ensuring they are identified, shamed and closed,&rdquo; Ndoro said. Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary general Wilson Sossion said, &ldquo;private&nbsp;schools&nbsp;have never been regulated. They cannibalise poor children and even clandestinely poach and register children from public&nbsp;schools&nbsp;to up grades.&rdquo; He added that the&nbsp;schools&nbsp;registered bright children in one examination centre and &lsquo;trash&rsquo; the rest in bigger classes to shore up results. Ndoro observed that some&nbsp;schools&nbsp;take bright pupils from public&nbsp;schools&nbsp;and register them in their centres to get good scores. Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers Secretary General Akelo Misori said the satellite centres must be closed. &ldquo;Some of these&nbsp;schools&nbsp;are doing funny things that are destroying the education sector,&rdquo; Mr Misori said yesterday. Elimu Yetu Coalition, an education civil society organisation, also weighed in on the matter and asked Matiang&rsquo;i to move fast. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
