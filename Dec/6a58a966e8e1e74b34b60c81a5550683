&nbsp;Accra: Ghana President John Mahama, facing a tough challenge in this week&#39;s election, said on Monday he had done his best in the past four years and deserved a second term to consolidate economic and infrastructure gains.&quot;I humbly ask for your mandate on Wednesday ... to complete the journey which we all started together,&quot; Mahama told thousands of supporters at the end of the ruling party&#39;s campaign ahead of Wednesday&#39;s vote. Mahama is seeking a second and final four-year term in what is expected to be a close race between him and main opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo. Voters will choose among seven presidential candidates and elect members of parliament for 275 constituencies.Ghana exports gold, oil and cocoa, but experienced a slump in global commodity prices and macroeconomic instability, forcing the government to adopt a three-year aid deal with the International Monetary Fund in April 2015.Mahama said that despite the challenges, the West African country made modest gains in stabilizing the economy, resolving a prolonged power crisis and improving social and economic infrastructure.&quot;We have done much work, but more needs to be done and we can only advance faster if we press on and stay the course,&quot; Mahama said.Mahama, 58, a former vice president, was elected in 2012 after serving six months as president to complete the term of John Atta Mills, who died in office.Akufo-Addo has said re-electing Mahama would threaten the nation&#39;s future, accusing the president&#39;s government of mismanaging the economy and unleashing hardship.Mahama&#39;s supporters, waving miniature party flags, filled the stands and inner perimeter of the 45,000-capacity Accra sports stadium, draped in a sea of black, red, white and green stripes.Among them was a group of five women aged 72 to 78 years, who said they showed up to celebrate Mahama for consolidating peace and unity in Ghana.&quot;He is not only doing his best for Ghana but he is also an epitome of peace, which we sometimes take for granted,&quot; one of them, Naa Teye, said.Ghana has held five successful democratic elections since 1992 and Mahama said he was hopeful the election would pass off peacefully.
