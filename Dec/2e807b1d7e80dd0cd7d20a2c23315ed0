The entry of Lydia Masikonte Ntimama in Narok County politics is likely to stir the region. Ms Masikonte, who is William Ole Ntimama&#39;s daughter, wants to vie for the Woman Representative&#39;s seat under the Jubilee Party. The incumbent Woman Rep Soipan Tuya was elected on United Republican Party, which has now folded, and is in the Jubilee Party&#39;s presidential campaign team. Ms Masikonte, who appears to be enjoying the support of Jubilee Party&#39;s top leadership says she wants to focus on pushing the women&#39;s agenda. &quot;I am vying for the seat on Jubilee Party because it is the way to go and I am here to stay,&quot; she says. &quot;What informed my decision to join the Women Rep race is the urge and desire to see our women and girls empowered.&quot; Ms Tuya is keen on retaining the seat and is banking on her development record in the utilisation of the Sh4 million National Government Affirmative Action funds. She says she has supported women and youth groups in the six constituencies to venture into businesses and has also provided school girls with sanitary towels.
