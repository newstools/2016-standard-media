Construction of a Sh4.3 billion shopping mall by the Safaricom Staff Pension Scheme and Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) is halfway done. The Crystal Rivers project, situated on Mombasa Road, about 1.2 kilomtres past the Athi River Interchange in Machakos County, consists of a shopping mall and a two-phase residential estate.Safaricom Staff Pension Scheme Board of Trustees Chairman Joseph Ogutu said yesterday about 10 per cent of the housing project is complete while the mall is 30 per cent done.The latter is set to be completed in quarter three of next year while the houses will be completed in 2018. However, the developer expects to have sold all space by next year.

Mr Ogutu said the mall will cater for the expanding middle class in Machakos and Nairobi counties.
