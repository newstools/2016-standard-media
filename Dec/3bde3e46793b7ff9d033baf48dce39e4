Wiper party leader&nbsp;Kalonzo Musyoka signalled his intent to secure the Opposition&#39;s presidential flag bearer&#39;s position moments after he was endorsed by party delegates to contest the top job. An uncharacteristically abrasive Kalonzo declared that he was ready to lead a united opposition against Jubilee. &quot;I do not want to be called a watermelon again. It used to be said that I can&#39;t sacrifice my candidature... but I have proved that wrong. I&#39;m not saying that I can&#39;t sacrifice anymore but we cannot stop what God has purposed. &quot;The message from here is to be selfless. I will not take any pretence. I have seen betrayal in this country. Let&#39;s not play games with politics anymore,&quot; said the former vice president He said he had sacrificed for other leaders in the past and that it was time for him to lead.

He said his candidature would be accepted by all Kenyans, making him the best person to beat Uhuru in next year&#39;s elections. Leader of Minority in the National Assembly Francis Nyenze (Kitui) fired the first reminder that Raila should support his party leader. &quot;In 2013 we supported Raila and agreed that he would support Kalonzo in 2017,&quot; said Mr Nyenze. Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr urged CORD partners to support Kalonzo in the next polls. &quot;We want unity among our top leaders but we want Kalonzo to be supported for the top seat. We are saying it clearly that Kalonzo is the best bet for the Opposition,&quot; he said. Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama, who has in the recent past been branded a Raila mole, also demonstrated all-out support for Kalonzo&#39;s candidature for the presidency.

The Wiper delegates also ratified the expulsion of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and five MPs for failing to toe the party line. The party&#39;s disciplinary committee under Lilian Omondi said Dr Mutua should be expelled from the party because he had formed another political party &ndash; Maendeleo Chap Chap &ndash; which does not share political ideologies with Wiper.
