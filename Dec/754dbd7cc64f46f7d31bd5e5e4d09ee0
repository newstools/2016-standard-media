There was grief at a village in Turkana County after it emerged one of their sons was among security personnel who died in the Naivasha accident. Constable Barnabas Mele from Nadapal village was&nbsp; attached to the elite G-Company General Service Unit team guarding President Uhuru Kenyatta. His mother Jacinta Nabei mourned her son, saying Mele had just been employed. &quot;My son was born in 1986 and was the sole breadwinner in the family. He was also the only educated member of this family. Mele was the only one I looked up to, to uplift us from poverty,&quot; said Nabei as tears welled in her eyes. She noted her son had a vision of changing their living standards. &quot;He was constructing four rental units that were yet to be roofed. My only prayer is that I will get enough assistance to complete what my son had started and also to support his niece, a Standard One pupil he has been taking care of,&quot; she added.

He sat for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam at Katilu Boys in Turkana South Sub-county before being recruited as a GSU officer,&quot; Mr Eregae said. Schoolmates and friends led by Joseph Ochieng described Constable Mele as a respectful, disciplined, focused and God-fearing young man.
