NAIROBI: The Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) has assured learners who have not received the examinations results that they will not miss out in the Form One selection. KNEC stated reasons as to why the 7,089 candidates did not receive their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCPE) results but said once issues that were raised are sorted the results will be released and updated. In a statement signed by KNEC acting chief executive officer Mercy Karogo reasons were given as to why some candidates did not receive their results. &quot;This is to bring to your attention that this is as a result of index number errors,&quot; read the statement. Some of the errors that have been identified included incorrect shading of index numbers; candidates mixing up index numbers; multiple candidates using same index numbers; and candidates using different index numbers in different subjects. Karogo said in the statement that once the errors are corrected, the actual results will be updated. She states, &quot;Candidates therefore, are informed to continue checking their Examination results.&quot; The 7,089 learners had their results marked XX and AB. But there were no cancelled results which has been attributed to the stringent measures that were put in place during this year&#39;s exams.
