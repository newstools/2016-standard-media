Kenyan roads have turned into death traps, taking at least eight lives every day. The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) puts annual estimates at 3,000 deaths, which is a conservative figure. And the economic loss attached to the accidents is enormous. NTSA estimates it at Sh300 billion annually (5.6 per cent of the country&#39;s GDP). On Saturday, at least 39 people lost their lives in a horrific accident after a truck carrying a highly flammable chemical lost control and rammed into a number of cars at Kinungi, Naivasha. On December 1, three people died while 13 others were injured when an Easy Coach bus collided with a matatu in Kamureito on the Kaplong-Bomet highway.

Other major casualties are 452 motor cyclists, 187 pillion passengers and 315 drivers. The number of those killed in 2015 stood at 2,715. MOST HORRIFIC Some of the most horrific accidents witnessed this year include the one that claimed six Kenyatta University students on July 2. And on September 12, four people died on the spot while three children sustained serious injuries following a road accident in Nairutia along the Nyeri-Nyahururu road. NTSA notes that most fatal accidents occur between 5pm and 10pm. It cites drink-driving, speeding and reduced visibility as some of the causes of accidents. In Nairobi County, Mombasa Road, Thika Road and Waiyaki Way are some of the top killer roads.
