According to NTSA, as at December 8, 2,741 persons have lost their lives on road crashes compared to 2015&#39;s 2,831. Of this, pedestrians still make the biggest number at 1,023 followed by 669 motorcycle related deaths, 658 passengers, 322 drivers and 69 pedal cyclists. The numbers represent a three per cent reduction in road fatalities but a recent trend threatens to change NTSA&#39;s milestones.

Four people died on Friday when a bus belonging to TSS Company veered off the road in Mazeras, Kilifi County on its way to Mombasa, injuring 21 others. According to NTSA&#39;s data, commercial vehicles like tankers and canters are the second leading in road fatalities cases with 29 per cent. Private vehicles are leading with 30 per cent. &quot;Most times people assume that Public Service Vehicles are the leading in fatalities because they openly flout traffic regulations but that is not the case,&quot; explained Dr Duncan Kibogong from the authority&#39;s road safety department. He added: &quot;That is why we are coming up with regulations to specifically enforce sanity in commercial transport. This sector has been lying unregulated for some time.&quot; The data ranks motorcycles as the third with 21 per cent, followed by Public Service Vehicles (PSV) 19, and government vehicles at one per cent.

Tricycles and tuk tuks were noted to contribute less than one per cent of the accidents.
