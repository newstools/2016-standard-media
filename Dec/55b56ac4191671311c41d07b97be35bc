&nbsp; Mogadishu: A suicide truck bomb hit the entrance of Somalia&#39;s biggest port on Sunday, killing at least 29 people, police said, an attack claimed by Islamist al Shabaab militants. The fighters said they were trying to disrupt protracted parliamentary elections - part of efforts to rebuild the fractured nation after decades of war. The three-month vote is due to end on Dec. 29. Gunfire rang out after the blast at Mogadishu Port, Mohamed Hussein, a worker there, told Reuters. Two others said work had been halted and staff sent home. The bodies of victims lay strewn outside the capital&#39;s terminal in a street filled with rubble from damaged tea shops. &quot;At least 29 civilians died and 50 others have been injured in the blast. We believe it was a suicide truck bomb,&quot; police officer Colonel Abdikadir Farah told Reuters. Al Shabaab&#39;s military operation spokesman, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, told Reuters the blast was aimed at police officers stationed close to the port. &ldquo;We killed 30 security forces and injured 50. We targeted them because they had been trained to provide security at so-called elections,&rdquo; he said. Al Shabaab&#39;s insurgency aims to drive out African Union peacekeepers, topple Somalia&#39;s western-backed government and impose its strict version of Islam on the Horn of Africa state. Around 14,000 people representing Somalia&#39;s federal states have been chosen to pick the 275 lawmakers. Those members of parliament will choose a new president. The government, U.N. officials and international donors have said security issues prevented a broader vote. Al Shabaab accuses the presidential and parliamentary candidates of being foreign stooges.
