Details of how a colourful ceremony turned tragic in a sleepy village in Bomet County are just beginning to emerge.Kapsaba village in Kipsonoi ward has remained largely deserted after the Friday ceremony that left three villagers dead and more than 200 others fighting for their lives in various hospitals in Bomet and the neighbouring Kericho County with suspected food poisoning after a passing-out ceremony of new initiates. When The Standard visited the village on Monday afternoon, most homesteads remained deserted except the home of Philip Koech and his wife, Winy Koech, where a few people were busy with burial preparations for his nine-year-old daughter who died following the incident.The couple had watched helplessly as their daughter, Sheila Cherotich, slipped away on Saturday morning after a harrowing Friday night ordeal.Cherotich, who was due to join Standard Five in Kaptulwa Primary School, came back home on Friday night after attending a ceremony for new initiates in the neighbours compound. Then the family&rsquo;s nightmare began.

Many of us were oblivious to the danger that lurked in the food,&rdquo;&nbsp; she said speaking from Kaplong Mission Hospital in Sotik.

She said the meal was a sumptuous mix of pilau, beans and beef stew.As they ate, however, the guests were unaware that part of the meal had turned poisonous, having being sourced from the previous day&rsquo;s festivities.&ldquo;We ate freely because we were at home but we did not know that the food was stale. We are hearing now from doctors that they suspect poisoning from the food we ate,&rdquo; she said.Some of the residents told The Standard that the organisers of Friday&rsquo;s fete took food that had been left over from a neighbouring home that had hosted the initiates the previous day (Thursday) to cut costs.&ldquo;The pilau in one of the sufurias was transported from a home that had hosted the initiates on Thursday. That is where the whole mess started,&rdquo; said one of the residents.The results were disastrous &mdash; almost an entire village is being treated for food poisoning and three people, including nine-year-old Cherotich, are dead.&ldquo;As you can see for yourself, all these homesteads stretching more than 4km are deserted because people are in hospital either seeking treatment or visiting their neighbours to console them,&rdquo; said Richard Langat, another resident.
