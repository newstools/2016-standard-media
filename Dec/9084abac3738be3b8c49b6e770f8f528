Universities have been warned against issuing &#39;fake&#39; degrees to politicians out to meet academic requirements for next year&#39;s polls. Reports have it that parliamentary and county assembly aspirants, including sitting MPs and MCAs, have been rushing to obtain academic certificates without even attending classes. Sunday, Higher Education Principal Secretary Colleta Suda said universities found issuing such certificates risk having their charters and letters of interim authorities withdrawn. Prof Suda said the ministry was keen to ensure the &#39;fake&#39; degrees&#39; rush stops in efforts to streamline higher education in Kenya. &quot;The ministry is aware that individuals, including politicians, have been approaching institutions of higher learning to secure diplomas and degrees to meet academic qualifications to vie for various posts. If a university is found to be involved in this racket, there will be dire consequences. We cannot allow people to buy degrees,&quot; Suda said.

When you register for a university programme, there are certain admission requirements you must fulfil. Additionally, the minimum contact hours must be met,&quot; Suda said, adding the ministry was determined to restore the integrity and credibility of university education in the country.
