Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has called on the Jubilee secretariat to take action against leaders inciting their supporters to disrupt the ongoing election of county officials.Speaking when he addressed over 1,000 residents of Evurori ward at his Kanyuambora home, Mr Kivuti said there was need for tolerance among leaders seeking elective seats on the party ticket in order to make it strong. Kivuti, who is eyeing the Embu governorship with Jubilee Party, condemned the violence witnessed during the election of party officials at Kangaru School last Tuesday and also at the national party headquarters.He said some of those disrupting the election of JP officials across the country were political moles.&quot;I condemn these uncivilised actions because they are not in tandem with the values that Jubilee Party stands for. This is unacceptable and those involved should be chased from the party,&quot; said Kivuti who is vying against Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and Governor Martin Wambora for the JP ticket to the primary elections.
