Owners of private schools have asked the Government to reduce taxes on laptops to make them affordable.Under the umbrella Embu County Private Schools Association, they said more than 5,000 pupils joining Standard One next year in the 160 private schools in the region risk missing out on the laptop programme offered in public schools. The association chairman, Francis Mbuthia, said they had entered an agreement with Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and a financial institution to supply the gadgets, but high cost was hindering their efforts.Speaking at Bonanza School, Mr Mbuthia said one laptop for&nbsp;pupils was going for Sh20,000 while that for teachers was Sh40,000, making the gadgets out of reach for many.&quot;Many parents feel the Government is discriminatory. We have petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to waive the tax on laptops or reduce it to enable more schools to afford them,&quot; he said.
