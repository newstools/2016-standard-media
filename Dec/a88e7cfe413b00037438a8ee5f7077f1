In 2009, Paul Murage, from Nyeri County, graduated from the National Youth Service Programme with a wide array of knowledge in metal work.He had high hopes of using his newly acquired skill to earn a living and he immediately went into employment in order to gain some much needed experience in this field. &ldquo;I not only got to sharpen my skill, I also learned where to source for raw materials,&rdquo; he says.Unfortunately, his employer closed shop and Murage was left to fend for himself. With just Sh500 in hand, he went on to buy some scrap metal.&ldquo;I made a jiko and some spoons which I then sold and made a profit. I used that amount to make two more jikos and eventually after selling several jikos, I was able to make my first chaff cutter which I sold at Sh15,000,&rdquo; he says.

When it was done, he was very impressed,&rdquo; Murage says.This proved to be a turning point for him as he realised that he could create a niche for himself in a market dominated by foreign manufacturers.&ldquo;The chaff cutters that farmers buy from local shops are often imported and are made of cast iron, which is very heavy but also has a tendency to crack,&rdquo; he said.To counter this, he used ordinary iron which he turned into stainless steel, which was more durable, lighter and locally available.&ldquo;Imported chaff cutters cost as much as Sh45,000 in a shop, but mine sell for as little as Sh25,000. I also offer a one year service guarantee whereby I fix it in case of any problems,&rdquo; he said.So far, his chaff cutters have been sold all over Nyeri County and in other counties across central Kenya, as word spreads about his affordable machines.
