The Church now wants the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) disbanded.In a hard-hitting address to the media, the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) said corruption in the country had reached alarming levels. NCCK General Secretary Peter Karanja accused the Government of laxity in handling graft and accused institutions charged with fighting the vice of finger-pointing instead of taking action.The organisation asked the President to spearhead the repeal of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2011 by Parliament and instead have a directorate under the Office of the President to deal with investigations and prosecution of corruption cases.&ldquo;The executive committee notes that in the fight against corruption, the saddest day for Kenyans this year was October 19, when they watched the proceedings of the Anti-Corruption Summit on live television.
