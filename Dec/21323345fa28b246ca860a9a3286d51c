Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has lost his bid to block Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu from challenging him in next year&#39;s elections.High Court Judge Joseph Onguto dismissed Mr Kabogo&#39;s application questioning Mr Waititu&#39;s integrity and academic qualifications, setting the stage for a titanic battle between the two for the Kiambu gubernatorial seat in 2017. &quot;The court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the allegations raised by the petitioner. There are other constitutional institutions tasked with determining the integrity and academic credentials of political aspirants,&quot; Justice Onguto ruled.On Waititu&#39;s integrity, the judge said Kabogo should have filed his complaint at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission instead of approaching the High Court.Onguto said it is only the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission that is mandated to determine the academic qualifications of a person vying for any elective position and that the petition lacked merit warranting court action.
