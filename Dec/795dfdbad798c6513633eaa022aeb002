Many memes are going around Kenya&rsquo;s social media describing honourable Millie Odhiambo&rsquo;s conduct in Parliament. In all fairness, whether Ms&nbsp;Odhiambo did the right thing or wrong depends on which side of the political divide you identify with.That is the tragedy of our politics. A lot has been said on how children are not being modeled in the right way when such obscenities are aired on live television, respect the presidency even if you do not respect the holder of the office and the list is endless. However, let us move away from the individual to the why she acted the way she did. I stand to be corrected but this despicable act should be blamed on party politics and more specifically the party organs.&nbsp;It is sadly evident that the behaviour experienced in the precincts of Parliament are just a call for attention seeking to show the party leader that they are working hard and protecting the parties ideals so that they can be given the party ticket because we lack free and fair nominations in Kenya.Why is it that we always hear aspirants saying; am in touch with the party leader? Political parties being vehicles by which citizens come together freely to campaign for public office, express their interests and needs and define their aspirations for their society, the major stakeholders are the citizens because their local concerns are placed in a national perspective; however, they have grown increasingly frustrated with their political parties and leaders and are widely distrusted by the public due to the trickery that comes into play during party nominations.When public confidence in political parties is compromised, the entire democratic process suffers. In all sustainable democracies, the party system must be deeply embedded in the fabric of our society this phenomena derails a key function that political parties perform in societies which is leadership pace setting.When functioning properly, political parties develop common ideas among a significant group in order to exert pressure upon the political system parties offering citizens meaningful choices in governance, opportunities for political participation, and chances to shape their country&rsquo;s future, in deed political parties do give birth to governments.As we get to the electioneering period it is incumbent on political parties to give room for greater citizen participation, accountability of leadership and transparency so as to regain the public&rsquo;s confidence.There is need to inspire confidence in party primaries so as to enhance transparency, increase participation and forestall misunderstandings by establishing clear rules and ensuring compliance.&nbsp;
