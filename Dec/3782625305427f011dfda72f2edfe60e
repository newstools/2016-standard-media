MERU: Peter Munya&#39;s Party of National Unity (PNU) has asked the Norwegian government to help protect Kenya&#39;s democracy by protecting small political parties. A member of PNU trustees Yuda M&#39;Imunya told the deputy ambassador of Norway Mr Vebj&oslash;rn Heines that Kenya&#39;s democracy was at stake as dominant political players sought to crush small parties. &quot;Norway has a history of supporting human rights and democracy and should step in to salvage the situation because we are seeing a worrying trend,&quot; M&#39;Imunya told the ambassador who was in Meru to inspect small scale farming projects supported by his country. The party official said by seeking to forcefully fold small parties, some players in the political field wanted to lock out rivals and deny them an opportunity to be elected on alternative tickets. &quot;The PNU believes that Norway can extend help to the besieged small parties without interfering in the internal affairs of Kenya,&quot; said the official. The diplomat started his visit to the country with a courtesy call on the Meru Deputy Governor Raphael Muriuki who was flanked by county secretary Julius Kimathi and M&#39;Imunya who is a member of the County Public Service Board.
