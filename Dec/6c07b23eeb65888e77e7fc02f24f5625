The Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) has described MPs as the worst enemies of devolution. Outgoing CRA Chairman Micah Cheserem claimed MPs and Senators were a threat to devolution in the country and asked them to review their position. Cheserem said the National Government retains 80 per cent of tax payer&#39;s money and gives county governments only 20 per cent. Speaking when he paid a courtesy call to Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti and his Deputy Hamilton Orata, Cheserem said MPs have the mandate to push the National Government to devolve more funds to counties. He expressed concern that 98 per cent of MPs were silent over revenue allocation yet their counties were getting too little amount of money from the State.

They are the ones with powers which can pressurize the concerned Government departments to give reasonable amount of money,&quot; Cheserem said. He accused senators for persistently engaging in war with governors saying such squabbles distract attention of governors from serving the people. &quot;Many senators are fighting their governors because they want to oust them in 2017. But this fight affects life of a common man,&quot; he added. He called on Kenyans to elect representatives who can support devolution during next year&#39;s general election. The CRA chairman however warned governors against corruption, saying that graft is the greatest obstacle to economic development in society. &quot;It is good the Chief Justice said corruption cases will be handled within three months. Any Governor found guilty of corruption should be sent home through any possible constitutional means,&quot; said Cheserem.
