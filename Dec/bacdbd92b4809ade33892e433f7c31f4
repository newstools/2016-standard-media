An elderly woman in Taita-Taveta County bitten by a snake on her way from the latrine died a long agonising death on Wednesday night.Leah Malagho, 70, joined the sad statistics of victims of the ongoing doctors strike after she was bitten by a poisonous snake locally known as &ldquo;nguluku&rdquo; at&nbsp;Mwatunge village along the Mwatate-Taveta road. She was rushed to a private hospital in Mwatate town but there was no anti-venom to treat her.&ldquo;We later rushed her to Voi County Referral Hospital where night guards told us that there were no health workers to deal with the situation,&rdquo; said Charles Cherera, the her cousin.&nbsp;Relatives made frantic efforts to rush Ms Malangho to yet another medical facility, St Joseph&rsquo;s Shelter of Hope in the outskirts of Voi town, where again they were informed that there was no anti-venom.

They still have to look for Sh32,000 to clear the hospital bill before the facility can release her body for burial.&ldquo;As a family we have so far raised Sh19,000 but the management of the hospital has told us that they will only release the body once we clear the remaining balance. We are appealing for help from friends and well-wishers to clear the balance,&rdquo; he said.The hospital&rsquo;s management could not, however, be reached for comment.This is not the first time a resident fell victim to the deadly reptiles in the area.

According to Tabu, earlier visits to the clinic had revealed that she was carrying quintuplets.Then labour pains set in.&ldquo;I was first taken to Taveta Sub County Hospital but all the health workers were on strike. My family and well-wishers decided to take me to across the border to Tanzania where I gave birth to five children,&rdquo; said the distraught woman.

Have you asked them (her relatives) whether they had taken the patient to St Joseph&rsquo;s Shelter of Hope?&rdquo; he said
