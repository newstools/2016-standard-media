The ongoing strike by the nurses across the country is largely underpinned by drastic disparities in pay and allowances in this cadre of health workers. Many nurses are bitter and demoralised as they are working under varying terms of service even though they are doing the same job. The nurses in counties comprise those from the national government and those absorbed from the former local authorities whose pay and allowances are yet to be harmonised. Other nurses have been employed directly by Counties under different terms of service, thereby enhancing the disparities among nurses serving in public health facilities even further. Currently, nurses in counties that were seconded from the national government in the lowest Job Group earn between Sh16, 692 and Sh21, 304 but those from the former local authorities in the lowest job group earn between Sh39,450 and Sh56, 730. Similarly, nurses seconded from the National Government in the highest Job Group earn between Sh152, 060 and Sh302, 980 but those from the former local authorities earn between Sh78,480 and Sh110, 615. The same picture of disparities is reflected in allowances.

Secretary general of the Kenya National Union of Nurses, Seth Panyako said the Collective Bargaining Agreement that nurses are pushing the Council of Governors to sign seeks mainly to harmonise the said disparities. &ldquo;We have been seeking to negotiate with COG to address the disparities but no progress has been made. That&rsquo;s why we called for a strike,&rdquo; he said. COG has refused to negotiate with KNUN until all counties sign a document recognising the union as the representative of nurses in their jurisdiction. The nurses through their CBA have proposed that certificate nurses entry point to be job group H moving up to job group M, while diploma nurses entry point to be job group J moving up to job group Q. Degree holder nurses entry point to be job group L moving up to job group U. Posts not classified as competitive form the common cadre whose advancements are guided by the scheme of service.
