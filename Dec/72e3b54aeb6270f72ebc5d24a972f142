Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto claims Jubilee plans to rig the next election in the county in favour of its candidate. Speaking at Ndanai grounds after opening a Chama Cha Mashinani office yesterday, Mr Ruto said &quot;recent actions by Jubilee and utterances by leaders trooping to the county are a clear indication that a plot has been hatched to manipulate the vote for their selfish interests&quot;. He did not, however, substantiate his allegations. &quot;It is unacceptable for a group of people to try and take hostage our people for selfish interests. We will not allow them to steal the vote and force leadership into the people of Bomet,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;As voters in Bomet we should come out and guard jealously our decision through the ballot and Jubilee from forcing its way to power.&quot; The governor was accompanied by Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ngeno and 13 members of the county assembly and several aspirants. Ruto used the rally to drum up support for his party, saying it was an alternative voice for the Kipsigis community.
