It was a walk-in walk-out scenario,&quot; Guyo added. He advised financial institutions and business enterprise to be to be wary of people posing as customers in banking hall, especially during this festive season. &quot;They strategically position themselves outside banks pretending to be customers but end up having other motives and in most cases end up being criminals,&quot; Guyo explained.
