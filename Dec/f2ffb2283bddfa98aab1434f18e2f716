Be careful how you dispose off old or used car batteries on the farm. They pose a great health risk to yourself and animals. Old car batteries contain a heavy metal called lead, which causes lead poisoning when ingested. But that is not the only source of lead on the farm; house paint, putty, oil filters and grease are other sources.Lead poisoning is common in dogs and cattle due to their inquisitive behaviour. Selective feeding in other animals is a protective trait against lead poisoning.Gasoline used to be a main source of lead poisoning in cattle on farms and those that grazed along motor highways until tetraethyl lead was eliminated from gasoline.

Some farmers use paint containers for watering animals, this can also be a source of lead to the livestock.In the management of lead poisoning, it is critical to first identify the source of the lead and prevent further access to it by the animal.In its acute form, lead poisoning will present clinical signs after 24-48 hours such as exposure blindness, excess salivation and eye twitching and shaking. This acute form is common in young animals. Dogs going blind and showing nervous signs is an early warning for lead poisoning.Older animals tend to have the sub-acute form that is characterised by absence of ruminal movements, constipation followed by diarrhoea, dullness and signs of stomachache like abdominal kicking.Continued exposure to lead in small doses over time results in impaired swallowing and aspiration pneumonia.Hungry animals are at a greater risk of exposure to lead poisoning as they can graze in areas where such batteries have been disposed of.Young calves kept in shades with painted walls can easily lick the paint when bored, ingesting just enough amount to cause lead poisoning.If diagnosed early, lead poisoning can be managed using Epsom salt (Magnesium Sulfate), which reduces further absorption of lead into the body and Vitamin B1 (Thiamine Hydrochloride), which reduces the effects of lead on the central nervous system.Lead poisoning is better prevented through proper disposal of farm equipment containing the metal.At postmortem, flakes of paint in the gastrointestinal tract is a pointer to lead poisoning.Meat from animals that have been exposed or died from lead poisoning should not be consumed by human beings.Lead can remain in an animal&rsquo;s body for long even when not showing any clinical signs.
