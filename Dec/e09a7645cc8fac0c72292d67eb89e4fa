Sirisia MP John Waluke has been proposed as the Jubilee Party interim Chairman in Bungoma County.Waluke was proposed by over 1,000 Jubilee officials who said that he has the guts to sell the party at the grassroots level. The proposal follows wrangles that were arbitrated by the patron Jubilee Youth league Mr. Evans Kakai who brought together Mr. Waluke and the former County Chairman of the defunct New Ford Kenya Martin Nyongesa who was battling for the County Jubilee Party chairmanship.Kakai has been instrumental in bringing together the two leaders and ensuring that the party gains popularity without internal wrangles.&quot;Am very happy that you convened here today after a long day arbitration, I hope we will work together in seeing that the Jubilee government retains power, all supporters of the party should make sure that we sell our party and its aspirants for us to succeed in the next general election,&quot; noted Kakai.
