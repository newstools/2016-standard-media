Police in Kisumu yesterday arrested 100 revelers, including students from various universities celebrating their graduation. There was drama at the Central police Station cells that was jammed to capacity, with several friends and relatives of those arrested turning up in big numbers to protest. Nyanza Regional Police Cordinator Willy Lugusa said those arrested were drunk and disorderly. Relatives, however, claimed the arrest was arbitrary and driven by malice. &nbsp;Most suspects spent the night on the floor because the cell was parked. Attempts by some local leaders including Central MCA Eddy Anayo, Governor Jack Ranguma&rsquo;s political advisor, Philip Obiero and a son to Nominated MP Oburu Oginga, Jaoko, were turned away by police, saying they acted within the law. Some were fined Sh3,000 and released on bond. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Kisumu MCAs refuse to break for recess with an eye for more allowances &nbsp;
