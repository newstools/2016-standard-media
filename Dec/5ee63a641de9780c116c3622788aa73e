NAIROBI: The stage is all set for a major battle on election laws pitting Jubilee and CORD coalitions in the National Assembly Tuesday.CORD has rejected the proposed amendments by Jubilee to the election law that is due to be discussed in a special sitting on Tuesday, called by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. Speaking in Homa Bay on Monday, CORD leader Raila Odinga said Opposition MPs were under instruction to shoot down the amendments at the earliest available opportunity. &ldquo;We are ready for this war tomorrow (today) and we must win it. Our MPs must go there prepared,&quot; Raila said when he opened the second edition of the Tourism and Luo Cultural Festival.Among the amendments rejected by CORD is the clause allowing the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to revert to a manual process should the electronic system fail.During a CORD parliamentary group meeting, the Opposition MPs vowed to reject the changes and spoke of unspecified action should the changes sail through.Led by CORD co-Principal and Senate Minority Leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula, the Opposition lawmakers said Jubilee had hatched a scheme with Speaker Muturi and Majority Leader Adan Duale to allow the amendment to be placed under the Order Paper.Mr Wetang&#39;ula argued that a special session of the House was normally called to deal with specific but urgent issues, adding that the amendments to the electoral laws ought to be done after consultation with the players.&quot;A special sitting of the House is called to deliberate on a specific but urgent matter. There are so many things included in the Order Paper that are not urgent at all. CORD will not sit idly by and wait for Jubilee to rubbish what we fought to have,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula.RIGGING TACTICSSiaya Senator James Orengo who co-chaired the Joint Select Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reforms accused Jubilee of executing a political assault aimed at stifling a free and fair General Election next year.&quot;Jubilee, which was chest thumping about their digital capabilities, is now championing a manual way of voting knowing that it will be difficult to manipulate an electronic system,&quot; Mr Orengo said.According to Orengo, the issues IEBC was trying to sneak through Parliament were envisaged in the law. Section 44(1) of the Election Laws Amendments state that there be established an integrated electronic electoral system that enables biometric voter registration, electronic voter identification and electronic transmission of results.&quot;The law has already provided that the commission ensures there is a telecommunication network for voter validation and result transmission and as such, IEBC should not look for an excuse,&quot; said Orengo.Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, who also served on the select committee yesterday, agreed that there was an agreement for the law not to be changed.But he said experiences from the Mosiro by-election in Kajiado County, where out of eight polling centres only the tallying centre had network coverage, called for a re-think.&quot;Do you realise that if this was a General Election, the entire process would have been cancelled because of mischief of interpretation? Lessons have also been learnt from Utah where in the recent US elections, technology failed and they had to resort to a manual process,&quot; he said.Mr Kuria added that the Constitution was clear that every Kenyan had a right to vote, which should not be subordinated to technology or other process.The MP warned that even if CORD went to court after the elections law was amended, it would lose.&quot;Constitutional right should not be denied because of failure by technology. Those people who are in areas not covered by telephony network have a right to vote. Even if CORD goes to the streets to demonstrate after losing in Parliament today, let them go,&quot; he said.During the Opposition&#39;s parliamentary meeting, the MPs agreed to execute their case on the floor of the House and present reasons why they were opposed to the manual system.The source intimated that the MPs were categorical that they would use any means to resist and oppose the amendment.&quot;We have agreed to use our brains. We are known to have tyranny of brains while they have tyranny of numbers. We shall present our case on the floor of the House and if that fails, CORD is not short of alternatives,&quot; said the source.The voting amendment seeks to give IEBC freedom to put in place alternative means of identification and transmission of election results besides the electronic means agreed during the bipartisan negotiations.The amendment says this should only be employed in areas with network problems.
