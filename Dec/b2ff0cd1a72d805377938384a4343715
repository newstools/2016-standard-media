Some top&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;members&nbsp;have been&nbsp;summoned&nbsp;by the&nbsp;party&#39;s disciplinary committee over a recent public rally in where leaders exchanged blows. Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti, Homa Bay Town MP Opondo Kaluma, Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga are set to appear before the Orange&nbsp;party&#39;s disciplinary team chaired by legal counsel Fred Athuok. Others also&nbsp;summoned&nbsp;are an aspirant for governorship Enos Bolo, Kaluma&#39;s rival Washington Ogaga, Homa Bay Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata, who is Kaluma&#39;s close ally, and youth leader Kevin Ouma alias Wau Wau. The Athuok-led team recently expelled a county chief, a deputy governor and eight MPs who are now facing a by-election over alleged breach of the&nbsp;party&#39;s constitution. Yesterday,&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;Chairman John Mbadi disclosed that the leaders had been&nbsp;summoned&nbsp;as was directed by&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;secretariat led by executive director Oduor Ongwen. &quot;We have said before that this&nbsp;party&nbsp;will not tolerate electoral violence. What we witnessed in Homa Bay is deeply worrying and we must act decisively,&quot; said Mbadi.

The chaos started at Kajwang&#39;s home in Waondo after a group of youth heckled Awiti and pelted his vehicle with stones. The county boss claimed the youth were paid and given illicit brew by one of his rivals.
