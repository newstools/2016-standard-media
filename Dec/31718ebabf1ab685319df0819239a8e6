Kenya&rsquo;s Miss World 2016 contestant emerged among the top five in the global beauty pageant held in Maryland, USA, on Sunday night.&ldquo;Grateful to God for top 5 #missworld2016. Super humbling. Thank you Kenya and world for praying and voting,&rdquo; tweeted Miss World Kenya 2016, Evelyn Njambi Thungu moments after the results were announced. Nineteen-year-old Stephanie Del Valle from Puerto Rico won the 66th edition of the contest that attracted more than 130 contestants.Although she did not win, the 23-year-old interior design student at Maseno University, whose crowning was marked with little pomp, will be remembered as the beauty queen who had the shortest time to prepare for a Miss World pageant.She was declared Miss Kenya after the controversy ridden dethroning of Roshanara Ebrahim in July.

She was our beauty queen. She was being paid Sh30,000 a month for her charity work and everything that is required of us to do for her, including wardrobe and photography was being executed. All this we can prove,&rdquo; said Ms Mungai.
