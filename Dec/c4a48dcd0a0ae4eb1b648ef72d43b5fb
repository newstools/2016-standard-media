Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has said that the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) behind the ongoing doctors&#39; strike was signed by mistake. Ranguma, who is the Council of Governors chairperson of health, said the clause on 300 per cent salary increment does not hold as the Government had already suspended it at the time the CBA was signed. &quot;The Government had suspended the 300 per cent increment in salaries clause in the CBA before it was signed in June 2013. So they cannot claim that they have a valid CBA,&quot; he said. Ranguma was speaking in Kisumu yesterday during a prayer meeting organised by the National Council of Churches in Kenya. Doctors want a 300 per cent salary increment, a standoff that has seen the strike last for 12 days now.
