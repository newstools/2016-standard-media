Over 20 Jubilee-allied MCAs are opposed to plans by Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa to vie for governor.The MCAs and some Jubilee Party (JP) leaders told Mr Wamalwa to stand by his decision to contest in Nairobi. The leaders led by Matumbei MCA Philip Sakong said the move by the CS to change his decision on the gubernatorial bid was causing confusion and could cost JP the Trans Nzoia County seat in 2017.Addressing a press conference in Kitale, Mr Sakong, who was accompanied by colleagues Gilbert Kitiyo (Kinyoro) and Rose Malinga (nominated) among others accused unnamed political brokers of pushing Wamalwa to abandon his gubernatorial bid at Nairobi.&quot;We gave our blessings (for) Eugene to shift his political base to Nairobi and it is a political blunder for some people to push him to return and contest the Trans Nzoia gubernatorial seat,&quot; Sakong said.
