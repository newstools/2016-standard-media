Nairobi residents will have dry taps beginning January next year as the city water supply company plans to ration the commodity.Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC) has announced that it will be forced to cut water supply for the next four months due to reduced levels in Ndakaini Dam and other sources. The rationing plan will run from January 1 until April 2017, when the country is expected to start receiving long rains.The company&#39;s Managing Director Philip Gichuki, however, said that should the country receive some rain before the long rains, the plan could be revised to ensure continued supply of the commodity.Mr Gichuki said the current short rains expected over the Aberdare catchment have been below average.

This means that the recharge of the rivers has been poor and currently the river flows are below normal affecting the extraction process,&quot; said Eng Gichuki.The rationing plan will see water supply in Nairobi reduced by about 13 per cent.This, the company said will mean that those receiving water five days a week will now receiving for four days.NCWSC said its current production is at 545, 034 cubic metre daily against a demand of 760,000 cubic metr. This is a shortfall of over 214 cubic metre.&nbsp;Gichuki further urged Nairobi residents to reduce use of water on non-necessary activities like car washing so as to ensure the available water can sustain the city until April.
