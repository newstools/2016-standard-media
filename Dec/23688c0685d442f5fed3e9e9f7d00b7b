Activist&nbsp;Okiya Omtatah has demanded to know why a firm owned by&nbsp;Borabu MP Benson Momanyi was paid Sh60 million in legal services fees by the Nairobi county government. &nbsp;In an Annual Audit Report for 2014/2015, the Auditor General Edward Ouko raised issues over the payment which he reported were not backed by documents. &nbsp;In a letter to the county dated December 15, Omtatah asked the county government to explain and provide comprehensive information on the nature of the cases that the law firms executed on its behalf. He also demanded the list of all pre-qualified law firms since 2012. -Jacob Ngetich
