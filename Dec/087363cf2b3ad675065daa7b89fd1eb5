Some HIV/Aids patients in Meru County have stopped collecting Anti-retroviral (ARV) Therapy drugs from health centres.HIV/Aids coordinator in Tigania East Cathy Suzanne said many of those infected could no longer be reached on their mobile phones.&nbsp;Approximately 26,019 people in Meru County are living with the virus, with 24,358 of them being adults. Children aged 14 and below living with the virus are estimated at 1,601.&nbsp;&quot;Our aim is to prevent new infections, especially among those aged 9 to 12 years, and other age groups,&quot; she said during the World Aids Day at Kangeta in Igembe Central.&nbsp;&quot;Every year, we have 1,127 new infections occurring among those aged 14 to 35 years. Of those aged 10 to 19 years, 2,538 acquire the virus each year,&quot; said Ms Suzanne.She said 13,751 adults are currently on ARVs, making up 64 per cent of those infected. Children under ARVs number 1,511, representing 94 per cent of those living with the virus.&quot;The health officer said a good number of mothers were accessing ARVs.&nbsp;&quot;There are 1,101 infected women under ARVs to prevent mother-to-child transmission, representing 97 per cent of the total number of those infected,&quot; she said.She added that taking preventive measures and getting tested were key to eradicating the disease.&quot;Adolescents should abstain and remain faithful to their bodies. Adults should consistently use condoms and remain faithful to one uninfected partner. We have free testing at all hospitals in Meru,&quot; said Ms Suzanne.&nbsp;She said promiscuity was undermining the fight against the killer disease.&quot;Behaviour change is important. Partners should be faithful and resist the temptation of wanting to &quot;change diet&quot; because when it comes to HIV, there is a high risk of acquiring the virus when you change sexual partners.&quot;She said the fight against the disease is also being compromised by the fact that very few people are willing to get tested.&nbsp;&quot;Many fear stigmatisation in case they are found to be HIV-positive,&quot; she said while urging residents to disclose their status to their partners for both of them to get medical assistance.&quot;There are HIV-positive individuals who after using the ARVs for two years claim they are healed and run away. They should know it&#39;s a life-long process they should religiously adhere to,&quot; said Ms Suzanne in reference to those who no longer take their medication.
