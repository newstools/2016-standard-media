Maina Olwenya was voted the best actor at the colourful Sanaa Theatre Awards held at the Kenya National Theatre last Wednesday.Mr Olwenya impressed the jury with his execution of the main character in &#39;A Man Like You&#39; written by Silvia Cassini of The Theatre Company. He beat Robert Agengo in &#39;Diplomat&#39;s Wife&#39; presented by Festival of Creative Arts (FCA) and Mombasa-based actor Ashik Yusuf in &#39;Don Geronimo&#39; by Kuldip Sondhi.&quot;I have acted all my life, have been nominated a number of times but this is my first-ever win.

She is worthy of her win,&quot; said Ms Waceke, who by all means would have won the award.Maryanne Nungo of FCA narrowly missed the Best Actress in a Supporting Role for an impeccable portrayal of a tormented mother in &#39;Nuts&#39; to Stephanie Masike of Little Theatre Club Mombasa for her role as the wife of Don Geronimo.Also in the contest in this category was Elizabeth Ngugi playing Cardace in &#39;Storm in the City&#39; by FCA.Irshad Abdullaziz of Kenyatta University Production, playing &#39;Euthanasia&#39; by Derrick Waswa, easily sailed through as the best actor in a supporting role, edging out Joe Kinyua for his role in &#39;Who&#39;s Your Daddy?&#39;But the biggest winner of the night was Kuldip Sondhi, a veteran playwright based in Mombasa. Not only did he win the best playwright with &#39;Don Geronimo&#39;, he also scooped the best play in English beating Derrick Waswa&#39;s &#39;Euthanasia&#39; and Silvia Cassini&#39;s &#39;A Man Like You&#39;.The Little Theatre Club Mombasa, where Sondhi is a trustee, won Most Improved Theatre Space ahead of Mageuzi Theatre, Pawa254 and Nakuru Players Theatre for its renewed vibrancy and hosting of many quality artistic events in the last one year.Ninety-year-old Sondhi, who swims three times a day to keep fit, was also presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by Dr Wario.&quot;I feel so honoured to receive this award which I dedicate to my late wife. When you are writing, you write a page at a time and never write as if to win a bestseller,&quot; said Sondhi, holding his golden trophy and a black umbrella that doubled up as his walking stick, and with his friend Tor beside him.Also receiving the Lifetime award was Wasambo Were of Kenyatta University.&nbsp;Dr Wasambo was the ever black director of the Kenya Schools and Colleges Drama Festival and is credited for Kenyanising and Africanising the fete that has become the quintessential training ground for many a thespian today.Leading author Ngugi wa Thiong&#39;o, playwright JPR Ochieng&#39; Odero and director Caroline Odongo also received the Lifetime Achievement Award.&quot;I am happy to receive this award and I am also happy to learn that Jalada, who performed a translated version of my work, &#39;The Upright Revolution&#39;, has also won in the category of Best Play in Local Language,&quot; said Prof Ngugi in a statement read on his behalf by Moses Kilolo of Jalada. He said many people did not know that Jesus did not speak Latin or English or Hebrew; he spoke Aramaic.But nobody knows that language. So we are talking about the Bible itself being a translation of a translation of a translation. And in reality, it has affected people&#39;s lives in history.The evergreen Kenyan Boys Choir directed by Joseph Muyale Inzai romped home with the Best Live Music Performance award, also named Daniel Pearl Award, ahead of Sarabi and Jukuua Live in Concert.
