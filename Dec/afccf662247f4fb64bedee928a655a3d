A section of African legislators want presidential term limits scrapped from the continent&#39;s constitutions.A joint Parliamentary Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) and European Union parliamentary session yesterday failed to impose presidential term limits among the member states. Presidential term limits are already in place in a number of countries including Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Ghana and Nigeria, among others, and are viewed as a key element for democracy.However, a number of African, Caribbean and pacific countries opposed the idea of tying term limits to development aid.Others called for the scrapping of presidential term limits altogether.
