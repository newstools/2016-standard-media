TRANS NZOIA: A modern classroom project developed at a cost of Sh1.2 million at St Joseph Primary school in Kitale through Saboti Constituency Development Fund (CDF) has been brought down after a heavy truck rammed on it. The facility that was recently completed, fully furnished and scheduled to be opened officially when schools re-open for the first term next year was extensively damaged. It is alleged that a man who had picked a quarrel with his father crashed a family lorry into the school project in Trans-Nzoia County, destroying the newly constructed classroom that was set to accommodate 40 pupils and improve infrastructural development of St Joseph Primary school. The man was reportedly driving the lorry towards their home in Wamuini village after he had quarrelled with his father in Kitale town when he lost control of the vehicle. Eyewitnesses said the man lost control of the lorry and rammed into the institution and hit the classroom whose construction was completed last month.
