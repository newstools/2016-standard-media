MPs have reacted angrily to an audit report that linked their constituencies to the loss of billions of shillings.A section of MPs whose constituencies are mentioned in the report have threatened to sue Auditor General Edward Ouko, saying the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) Act excludes them from the management of the cash.National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale accused the Auditor General of using audit reports for political reasons. On his Garissa Township Constituency, the audit report raised queries over failure by the CDF team to account for Sh9.1 million awarded for bursaries. It further questions Sh6 million over-expenditure as well as irregular awarding of tenders worth Sh2.9 million.Starehe MP Maina Kamanda &ndash; whose Constituency allegedly wasted Sh39.6 million in the construction of toilets &ndash; said the report was not factual since the facilities had been handed over for use by constituents.Kiambu Town also defended itself from the auditor&rsquo;s queries. The audit report stated locals did not get value for the Sh3.1 million spent in constructing Ting&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a chief&rsquo;s camp, Kirigiti AP Post and Ngatia assistant chief&rsquo;s office since they had not been put to use.Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka defended himself against the accusation that his constituency misappropriated Sh21.2 million.&ldquo;I have never had any audit query except for the one of 2008 and which I am now fighting in court,&rdquo; said Onyonka.&nbsp;Kieni MP Kanini Kega said allegations that his Kieni constituency misspent Sh21.4 million is false, alarming and out to tarnish his name.&ldquo;This information is absolutely false and absolute nonsense. If there are audit queries, it&rsquo;s the CDF manager that is questioned. This is irresponsible and we shall meet in court,&rdquo; said Kega.His Balambala counterpart Abdikadir Aden also dismissed the audit report saying all the issues it raised will be made clear once it is tabled in Parliament.Kilifi South MP Mustafa Iddi read politics in the report.&nbsp;&ldquo;MPs have no role in the management of CDF. Don&rsquo;t make it political, my friend,&rdquo; he said.(Reporting by Moses Nyamori, Wilfred Ayaga, Rawlings Otieno)
