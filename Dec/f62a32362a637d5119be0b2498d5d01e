An ODM official has been arrested for alleged illegal possession of a gun. However, police later released the county ODM youth leader, Kevin Ouma alias Wauwau, after a search in his house found no gun as reported by a police informant. Mr Ouma, who is one of the Homa Bay County leaders summoned by the party headquarters over violence, was arrested by police in Homa Bay town on Saturday night. A group of youths stormed Homa Bay Police Station a few minutes after his arrest demanding his release. County Police Commandant John Omusanga said they arrested Ouma after a tip from the public that he was in possession of an unlicensed gun. Mr Omusanga said they would ensure that nobody owned an illegal gun in the area.

Ouma denied owning&nbsp;an unlicensed gun. &quot;I don&#39;t own any gun. Those who are spreading the propaganda are doing so because they fear me after we differed on political grounds,&quot; he said. Other politicians summoned to the party headquarters over the violence in Homa Bay a few weeks ago include Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti, Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma and aspirant Washington Ogaga. Others are Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata, Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga and aspirant Enosh Bolo. They will be questioned about their role in the violence.
