The Commission on Revenue Allocation&rsquo;s (CRA) outgoing chairman, Mr Micah Cheserem, wants constitutional amendments to be introduced to allow governors to hold office for one eight-year term so that they can focus on running their counties. Speaking when he paid a courtesy call to Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti and his Deputy Hamilton Orata, Mr Cheserem said governors often found themselves distracted during elections and are therefore unable to effectively manage their counties. &ldquo;Governors should serve for a continuous term of eight years to shield them from the pressure of competing in General Elections,&rdquo; said Cheserem. The chairman said this would give governors ample time to undertake development projects. &ldquo;Many governors are under pressure to campaign in order to retain their seats. That pressure would not be there if they had a single term of eight years,&rdquo; he added. ALSO READ: Governor Joho emerges best in local revenue generation
