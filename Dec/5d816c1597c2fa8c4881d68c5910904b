NAIROBI: Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists board has warned doctors&#39; union against interfering with normal services in mission and private hospitals.The board has threatened to take disciplinary action against any doctor who will be reported to have stopped normal operations in the said hospitals.In a statement, the board chair Prof George Magoha said he has been brought to attention over a threat by the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) that starting Tuesday they will paralyse all clinical services in all mission hospitals and private clinics. Magoha said the move will be contravening the Constitution on the public&#39;s right to access medical services.&quot;The board notes that the call for stoppage of all services in private hospitals not only interferes with management and operations of private hospitals but also interferes with public right to access health care as espoused in the Constitution,&quot; said Magoha.Magoha said the board therefore demands that no medical or dental practitioner should disrupt services in private and mission hospitals.&quot;The health facilities should report to the board and the police anyone who threatens their employees, or disrupts normal services,&quot; he said.Magoha also asked the government to spare no efforts to ensure anyone who interferes with the services is dealt with decisively in accordance with the law.&quot;The board warns that it will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against any practitioner who will be found to have contravened this directive,&quot; said Magoha.Magoha further appealed to the government and KMPDU to fast track the ongoing negotiations to alleviate the suffering of Kenyans and avert loss of lives.
