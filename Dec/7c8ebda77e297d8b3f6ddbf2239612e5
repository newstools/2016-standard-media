Mt Kenya Academy Junior School has distanced itself from a report linking it to registration of multiple examination centres. Referring to an article published in Standard on Saturday which reported that 20 private schools were facing a ban, headteacher Edward Obuya said all 73 candidates were registered in one centre. &ldquo;Our school upholds its core values of integrity and excellence in all its operations. It cannot and has never been involved in any malpractices,&rdquo; said Obuya. Ndiga Lewis Mutwiri (pictured) scored 429 marks, one of the best in the county, while the lowest had 277 marks out of the possible 500.
