Opposition chiefs have called for peaceful street protests against amendments to the election laws passed by Jubilee MPs yesterday.CORD leaders Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula said the Jubilee administration had voluntarily forced them back to the streets. Hours after the amendments were passed, Opposition chiefs met and vowed that come January 4, 2017, they would be back to the streets in mass action protests.&ldquo;We have consulted and come to the conclusion that the Jubilee administration does not want Kenyans to enjoy peaceful Christmas. They have now invited us back to the streets and we welcome their invitation,&rdquo; said Mr Kalonzo.The Wiper Party leader said the Jubilee administration had shown high level of impunity and intolerance in the manner in which they passed the amendments.

We don&rsquo;t want war but peace. No transparency, no elections,&rdquo; said Raila.
