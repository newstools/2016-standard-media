Two chang&#39;aa traders were Friday jailed for six and five months apart by a Kakamega court after they pleaded guilty to selling traditions liquor (Chang&#39;aa) without licensee. Rose Ingando and Ruth Andeso were charged before Kakamega resident magistrate Benson Khapoya with selling 20 and 15 litres of chang&#39;aa respectively on the 7th of December with no license. Ingando was arrested at Ikuywa village as Andeso was arrested at Bushirika village while in the act of selling the illicit brew together with their clients who were charged with being drunk and disorderly. The two pleaded guilty each and mitigated that &quot;poverty made me brew illicit drink&quot; and proceeded to ask the court to free them with a promise not to repeat the offence. State counsel Paul Juma told the court that the accused had committed the offense for the first time. The court jailed Ingando for six months with an option to pay Sh20,000 and five months for Andeso with an option to pay Sh 15,000 to serve lesson to the growing trend in the festivities of brewing illicit liquor.
