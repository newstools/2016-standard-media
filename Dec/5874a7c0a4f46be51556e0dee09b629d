The High Court has allowed the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) to challenge the&nbsp;decision by Parliament to convene special sittings to debate the controversial changes to the election laws.Justice Joseph Onguto noted that CORD&rsquo;s case is not only of great public interest but also raises weighty constitutional issues that require determination by the court. &ldquo;The petitioner (CORD) has an arguable case that requires this court&rsquo;s interpretation. I direct the petitioner to serve the respondents within seven days and appear in court for further directions,&rdquo; Justice Onguto ruled.CORD moved to court on Wednesday to challenge the decision by the&nbsp;National Assembly and the Senate to call for debates to discuss amendments on the election laws.The coalition argues that the law requires that all political parties be consulted or involved in decision-making processes that relate to the proposed amendments.
