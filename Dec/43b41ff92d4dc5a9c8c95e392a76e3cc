City Hall has demanded a list of expired land leases from the National Land Commission (NLC). This comes days after a family was evicted in Westlands and their house demolished by a developer claiming he had taken over ownership of the property.Governor Evans Kidero Wednesday faulted NLC, saying the commission might have renewed the land lease without consulting his government, leading to the eviction of Purin Kurji, 74, who claimed to have owned the land since 1972. Dr Kidero denied that county officers were involved in the eviction, saying the officer who purportedly signed the couple&#39;s eviction notice was not a county employee and that the notice did not originate from City Hall.The governor however confirmed that the 99-year lease on the land had expired but denied recommending to the commission a renewal because no one had come forward to apply for one.
