Sasini Limited wants to put up a macadamia factory in Kiambu County as it branches into the lucrative business. The new macadamia processing facility will be established in a 20 acre farm at a cost of Sh400 million. The location is strategic given that it is in Export Processing Zone which is in close proximity to its coffee mill in Kiambu.Making the announcement, Group Chairman Naushad Merali said the factory will be crucial in helping the firm diversify into macadamia to offer farmers and the company new revenue streams. He added that the plan is to inter-plant macadamia with the coffee bushes at calculated spacing so that the two can thrive together without needing additional land. &ldquo;This is being planted at desirable spacing which will not compromise on coffee production. We anticipate to generate a further Sh300,000 per hectare from this venture within the coming six years when we shall be at optimal production of macadamia nuts,&rdquo; said Mr Merali.The ground breaking ceremony for the factory is set for December 19 as the management mulls January 2018 as the operational date. In preparation, Merali said the firm has planted about 6,000 seedlings in its coffee plantations. This is in addition to more than 20,000 seedlings in nurseries which he said will soon be planted in the expanded pilot project.All its affiliated coffee farmers in the country will be supplied with the seedlings starting next year. Merali assured them that the plant will not interfere with coffee&rsquo;s production cycle since enough research has been undertaken before arriving at the decision.&ldquo;This is geared towards diversifying farmers&rsquo; income and contribute to enhancing coffee farms productivity,&rdquo; he said adding that the research team is still looking for other coffee friendly ventures to complement their income during low seasons.
