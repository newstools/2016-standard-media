Public university workers have threatened to go on strike on January 11 next year if the Government does not give them a 300 per cent pay rise.The University Academic Staff Union (UASU) and the Kenya Universities Staff Union (KUSU) yesterday said the Government has 17 days to call for negotiations over the salary increase. The unions&rsquo; officials said the 300 per cent increment will harmonise their salaries with other lecturers and other university workers across the world and should be backdated to July 1, 2013.The workers are asking for a minimum salary of Sh350,000 for an assistant lecturer in job group 11 and a minimum of Sh1.5 million to a maximum of Sh1.9 million for a full professor.&ldquo;We have done research across the world and realised that we are the least paid. Even Dar-es-Salaam University next door pays more than what we get here,&rdquo; said Joseph Mberia, UASU national vice chairman.
