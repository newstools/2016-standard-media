Former Karachuonyo MP, Phoebe Asiyo wants the doctors&#39; strike declared a national disaster.She said many Kenyans were dying at home because of the worsening crisis in public hospitals. Mrs Asiyo who broke down and wept as she spoke to The Standard on phone, said: &quot;Dear Mr President, Kindly help our people who are dying at home. Kindly end this strike. I know you can do it. I know you can speak to these doctors as the father of this nation.&quot;She said the President must take full charge of the deteriorating situation by declaring it a national disaster and mobilising all players in the health sector to address the problems doctors face.&quot;As a mother and a leader I feel for those whose children and spouses are dying at home because they cannot afford private hospitals. But even the private hospitals are not functioning well because the consultants working there are the same ones on strike,&quot; Asiyo said.

If there are no sick people in the hospitals, where are they and who is treating them?&quot;She told the President that although the Government could not be having enough money to pay the doctors, he could reduce the suffering of patients by directly speaking to the doctors.She spoke as key Government hospitals across Nyanza remained deserted even after nurses who were also on strike resolved to resume work last week.At the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral and Teaching Hospital and the Kisumu County hospital, nurses turned away patients with ailments that required doctors&#39; attention. They could only dress wounds and give prescriptions for headaches and malaria.
