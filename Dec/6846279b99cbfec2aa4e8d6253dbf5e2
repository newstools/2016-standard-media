The Kisumu County government has urged businesses to source goods locally to uplift suppliers.Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga said it was unfortunate that some supermarkets have been buying products from other regions, yet they are readily available in the county.Speaking during the launch of the second Khetias Supermarket branch in Kisumu town, Ms Odinga said denying local suppliers tenders was an affront to the local economy. &quot;I am happy this is the second Khetias Supermarket being launched in Kisumu. Do not only support us by directly employing our people. We would also like you to buy vegetables grown by locals,&quot; she said.Ms Odinga, however, said this does not mean businesses compromise on the quality of products sold to customers by accepting substandard goods.She urged more investors to explore available business opportunities in Kisumu, saying it is a gateway to other regional markets.
