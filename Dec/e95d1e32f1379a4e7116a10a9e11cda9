Farmers who attended yesterday&#39;s Kimalel goat auction accused its organisers of rejecting animals supplied by peasants in preference for those supplied by politically-connected individuals. They said the popular event presided over by Deputy President William Ruto had lost meaning to farmers, many who had to return home with 650 goats that were rejected. The DP declared that 2,326 goats were auctioned in the event that is held annually and has acquired a symbolic significance for local people over the years. Joseph Bowen, a Bartabwa farmer accused the county administration of ensuring that goats supplied by peasant farmers were not offered for the auction. &quot;These are the legitimate Baringo farmers; the goats sold today belong to brokers and the rich,&#39;&#39; said Mr Bowen.

Yesterday DP Ruto accused the media of reporting that &nbsp;his close&nbsp; associates had taken goats for free during last year&#39;s auction. The DP set the minimum auction price at Sh12,000 per goat for those buying 50 or more goats. Those who were buying less than 50&nbsp; goats paid no less than Sh15,000 per goat. &quot;Some people reported that goats were never paid for. I need my receipt so that I can produce it elsewhere should issues arise,&#39;&#39; said the Deputy President. It was estimated that farmers from the region may have&nbsp; received as much as Sh28 million from the sale of their goats President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy paid Sh7.38 million for 616 goats while other goats were&nbsp; purchased by politicians, civil servants and businessmen. The objective of the event is to provide farmers with a market for their goats preceding the Christmas period.
