The electoral agency has accused the Opposition of lying to get court orders stopping the Sh2.4 billion tender for ballot boxes.Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chief executive officer Ezra Chiloba swore that CORD did not present true facts relating to their preparations for next year&#39;s elections. &quot;The misconception of CORD is that the general election, to be held in August 2017, will be wholly electronic. The election shall be substantially manual in the sense that physical ballot papers are still required for the exercise,&quot; said Chiloba.SIGNED CONTRACTMr Chiloba defended the tendering process, saying his agency complied with all regulations before signing a contract with Al Ghuraiar Printing and Publishing Company.

It is, therefore, inappropriate to question our choice of procurement through a judicial review application at the High Court,&quot; swore Chiloba.
