Helpless families yesterday flocked to private and low-cost mission hospitals to seek medical assistance for their ailing relatives.This was happening as the nationwide doctors&rsquo; and nurses&rsquo; strike entered its second day.With a majority of public hospitals in Nairobi deserted, patients had to dig deep in their pockets to seek treatment from costly faith-run institutions which are, in essence, cheaper than high-end private institutions. Catholic Church-run Ruaraka Uhai Neema Hospital along Thika Superhighway was among the facilities which received more patients.Some were referred there from public hospitals both in Nairobi and Kiambu counties.A source who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media said that by midday, they had received 10 referrals from Nairobi&rsquo;s Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital and other public hospitals in Ruiru and Kiambu.He said that even though they received large number of patients, they lacked capacity to handle some cases which required specialised treatment.The hospital&rsquo;s maternity ward was also full to capacity, forcing the facility to create space in another ward to accommodate the swelling numbers that would ideally have visited Pumwani Hospital.A similar situation was witnessed at St Francis Community Hospital on the Kasarani-Mwiki road. However, it did not receive as many patients.Elsewhere across the country, private hospitals were struggling to cope with an influx of patients owing to the industrial action.A spot check by The Standard at Nyeri County&rsquo;s Consolata Mathari Mission Hospital confirmed that the number of women admitted to the maternity ward had increased from 36 to 60 since Sunday.Bernard Murithii, the hospital&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer said that the inpatient capacity was 167 patients, but they were currently accommodating 209 people.Women crammed into the maternity ward, with additional beds lined along a pathway to accommodate more patients.The county administration has offered additional beds, linen and mattresses to assist the facility cope with the high number of patients.HIGH NUMBERSIn Murang&rsquo;a County, dozens of patients were moved by relatives to private institutions, with facilities in Maragua and Kenol recording high numbers.On Monday, an expectant woman gave birth at the entrance to Murang&rsquo;a District Hospital. The medical officers&rsquo; strike started that morning.Dr David Oluoch, the Kakamega County Director of Medical Services yesterday visited several private hospitals, urging them not to turn away patients. He promised that the county will offset some of the patients&rsquo; bills.A spot check by The Standard established that private facilities, including St Mary&rsquo;s Mumias Mission and Mukumu Mission hospitals, recorded a surge in patients from Sunday.Michael Mugo, the hospital administrator at St Mary&rsquo;s Mumias&nbsp; confirmed that the facility was overwhelmed, especially its maternity wing.The facility received 29 expectant mothers on Monday, with the number rising to 40 yesterday.The institution also received 17 patients from Butere District, Kakamega County General and Matungu hospitals.The story was the same in Kericho County, which recorded a mass exodus of patients from public to private health facilities, at least for those who could afford it.At Ward Six of the Kericho District Hospital, Paul Odhiambo Oliech, a double leg amputee who had been recuperating at the facility after being involved in a road accident, summed up the hopelessness of the patients.The 45-year-old said his medical bill stood at Sh122,000 which he could not afford, let alone raise money to move to a private hospital for specialised treatment.Elsewhere, patients in Laikipia County were forced to turn to Nyahururu Private Hospital, Charity Medical Centre as well as other private institutions within the town to get treatment.These saw them admit the highest number of patients ever witnessed.&ldquo;We have recorded a very big number since Monday and our staff is overworked.&ldquo;However, we have managed to deal with the crisis and all the patients are being treated,&rdquo; said Erastus Mureithi, the proprietor of Nyahururu Private Hospital.&mdash; Reports by Lonah Kibet, Lydia Nyawira, Boniface Gikandi, Ignatius Odanga, Nikko Tanui and James Munyeki
