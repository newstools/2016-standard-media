Parents will be hit with high&nbsp;fees&nbsp;shocker when&nbsp;schools&nbsp;open next year, as&nbsp;principals&nbsp;device clever ways of concealing outlawed additional levies. The Standard on Saturday has established that most secondary&nbsp;schools&nbsp;are still pushing parents to pay&nbsp;fees&nbsp;above the ministry set guidelines, even as Education officials talk&nbsp;tough&nbsp;on capped rates. A random check on sampled&nbsp;fee&nbsp;structures and interviews with some parents reveals that while some&nbsp;schools&nbsp;have glaring high&nbsp;fees, others have the right amount on printed official documents, but additional&nbsp;fees&nbsp;instructions issued separately. And some&nbsp;principals&nbsp;issued&nbsp;fee&nbsp;structures &ndash; that are not signed or rubber-stamped &ndash; to parents, while others published documents indicating&nbsp;fees&nbsp;for only one term to escape the keen eyes of parents and education officials. And despite the government ban on mock examinations, some&nbsp;schools&nbsp;still solicit funds towards the tests, while others still demand Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) facilitation&nbsp;fees.

If not&nbsp;regulated, 2017 will be the third year&nbsp;school&nbsp;heads will have flouted the 2015&nbsp;fees&nbsp;guidelines that set&nbsp;fees&nbsp;for day&nbsp;schools&nbsp;at Sh9,374 per year. The guidelines gazetted in March 2015 sets boarding&nbsp;school&nbsp;fees&nbsp;at Sh53,554 per year and&nbsp;fees&nbsp;for special&nbsp;schools&nbsp;were pegged at Sh37,210 annually. Government subsidy The rates were arrived at after deducting the government subsidy of Sh13,000 per child per year. But at Alliance Girls High&nbsp;School, for instance, transaction documents seen by The Standard on Saturday shows that parents paid up to Sh127,000 this year. A student&rsquo;s&nbsp;fees&nbsp;statement printed October 26, 2016 shows that in 2015, the&nbsp;school&nbsp;charged&nbsp;fees&nbsp;of up to Sh133,000. But the&nbsp;fee&nbsp;structure released by the&nbsp;school&nbsp;for 2017 only indicates that parents will pay Sh43,554. Nakuru Girls High&nbsp;School&nbsp;only issued&nbsp;fees&nbsp;structure for term one &ndash; January 2017. The document indicates that Form Two students will pay Sh36,700, Form Three students to pay Sh42,800, while those in Form Four will pay Sh36,700. The lack of&nbsp;fees&nbsp;details for the other terms makes it difficult for parents to quickly notice the likely high&nbsp;fees&nbsp;they are required to pay.

St Georges Girls Secondary&nbsp;School&nbsp;(Nairobi) shows that parents will pay Sh53,554 next year. But the document includes additional&nbsp;fees, which brings the total payable in 2017 to Sh77,138. St Augustine Nyamonye Girls, for instance, indicates that the total&nbsp;fees&nbsp;is Sh53,554 &ndash; within the set guidelines &ndash; but demands additional payments of up to Sh17,000 to parents. Among the additional levies are Sh2,000 mock&nbsp;fees&nbsp;for Form Four students, Sh5,000 for academic support programmes and Sh4,000 loan repayment&nbsp;fees. At Kakamega High&nbsp;School, the 2017&nbsp;fees&nbsp;structure says parents resolved in August 2016 to pay Sh63,400. The document also lists additional payments, bringing the total&nbsp;fees&nbsp;payable next year to Sh75,430. Finer details of the additional levies reveal that&nbsp;school&nbsp;heads have ignored the ministry&rsquo;s directive that outlawed charges levied on parents. For instance, some&nbsp;school&nbsp;charge mock&nbsp;fees, varying lunch levies and County Education Board (CEB)&nbsp;fees. Others also ask parents to pay activity&nbsp;fees&nbsp;for Kenya Secondary&nbsp;SchoolHeads Association (KESSHA), while others include&nbsp;fees&nbsp;for additional uniforms. ALSO READ: Kenya: Public school maintains excelling streak A circular released by Dr&nbsp;Matiang&rsquo;i&nbsp;this year lists only 10 vote heads, complete with parents&rsquo; contributions. The document says parents will not pay for meals in day&nbsp;schools&nbsp;and outlawed PTA funds and any other &ldquo;top-ups&rdquo;. &ldquo;Parents are therefore advised to only pay the amount in the Gazette notice and report incidents of any students turned away for not paying&nbsp;fees&nbsp;to their respective County Directors of Education,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Matiang&rsquo;i. This means no student should be sent home for&nbsp;fees. But some&nbsp;fee&nbsp;structures instruct parents that no child will be allowed in&nbsp;school&nbsp;before making payments. Another circular by Teachers Service Commission (TSC) Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia dated January 2016 cautions heads against high&nbsp;fees. &ldquo;Schools&nbsp;should adhere to gazetted&nbsp;fees&nbsp;guidelines without exception. As secretaries of the Boards of Management (BoM),&nbsp;principals&nbsp;should advise boards, parents, guardians and stakeholders on the provisions in the Gazette notice on&nbsp;fees&nbsp;guidelines,&rdquo; said Macharia. Yet another circular released by Education PS Belio Kipsang warns that no&nbsp;school&nbsp;will be allowed to take money beyond acceptable limits. The circular dated October 31 cites President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s August 19, 2016 directive on&nbsp;fees&nbsp;guidelines for all public&nbsp;schools. But even as the government fumbles with the implementation of the&nbsp;fees&nbsp;directive, parents at Kisumu Boys High&nbsp;School&nbsp;will pay Sh60,754, Kereri Girls (Kisii) Sh66,423, Orero Secondary&nbsp;School&nbsp;Sh79,854 and Rang&rsquo;ala Boys Sh64,254.

Matutu Adventist Secondary&nbsp;School&nbsp;is asking for an additional charge of Sh8,000 KCSE examination&nbsp;fees, which had been scrapped. Parents at Ambira High will pay Sh75,154&nbsp;fees. The&nbsp;school&nbsp;also included Sh7, 600 for joint examinations, Sh6,060 PTA levies and Sh2,500 uniform&nbsp;fees. Parents at Sironga Girls will pay Sh78,859 and additional levies of Sh7,750 for uniform.
