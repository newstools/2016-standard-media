Former head of ODM secretariat Eliud Owalo has alleged a plot to hand party leader Raila Odinga&#39;s daughter the ticket in Kibra parliamentary nominations. Owalo, who has launched his campaigns to unseat the incumbent Ken Okoth, claimed there is a plot by some party officials to elbow other candidates out of the race in favour of Ms Rosemary Odinga. In a protest letter to Mr Odinga, and which The Standard has seen, Owalo said the alleged scheme amounts to imposing someone on the people and called for fair nominations. &quot;I am perturbed by objectively verifiable reports that there is an elaborate scheme to impose Ms Rosemary Odinga on the good people of Kibra Constituency as the ODM parliamentary candidate for purposes of the 2017 General Election. ODM&#39;s National Elections Board must not play to the whims of any candidate,&quot; reads Owalo&#39;s letter. ALSO READ: Why Opposition stands better chance
