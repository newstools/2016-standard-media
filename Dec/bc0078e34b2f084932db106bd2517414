A rebel Jubilee MP stuck out his neck against the contentious changes to election laws even as the Opposition staged a dramatic walk out from the House yesterday.Emurua Dikirr&#39;s Johanna Ngeno struggled to be heard above the din of the shouting colleagues who appeared keen to rush through the changes and proceed for Christmas. The MP was able to attract the attention of Speaker and voiced his opposition to the proposed changes. He told the House it is still possible to identify voters without necessarily relying on fingerprints.&quot;We had agreed that these machines have not been manufactured and they can therefore be manufactured in such a way fingerprints are not the only way of identifying the voters,&quot; Ngen&#39;o said before his micro phone was switched off.The MP has distinguished himself as a fierce critic of Jubilee government. On Tuesday, Ng&#39;eno told his Jubilee colleagues that unlike most of them, he has no godfather. He told his colleagues he is only answerable to his own conscience. &quot;I am a godfather of my own,&quot; he said before the House degenerated into disarray. And yesterday, Ng&#39;eno said he was shocked at the way Jubilee MPs pushed through the changes.
