I will not allow him to destroy my constituency,&quot; Mr Ngunjiri said.The legislator claimed the businessman was using his wealth to undermine JP activities in the county by influencing the appointment of officials.But in a quick rejoinder, Mr Manyara told Ngunjiri off, saying the MP participated in the process that saw his appointment and that of 10 other officials.
