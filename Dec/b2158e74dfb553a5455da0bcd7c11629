Interviews for candidates eyeing the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) top job have come to an end.The selection panel yesterday concluded interviewing the last batch of IEBC chairperson hopefuls, an exercise that also saw one of the candidates withdraw from the race at the last minute. Lawyer David Mereka shocked the Bernadette Musundi-led selection team when he pulled out of the race, saying he wanted to give the chance to a younger person.&quot;I am 64 years old, the oldest short-listed applicant in this interview. I have watched the interviews for the last two days. The applicants are younger, resourceful, brilliant and ready to serve,&quot; he told the panel.&quot;I have decided to withdraw my candidature to support the two-thirds gender rule and allow younger applicants to take charge of IEBC.&quot; ALSO READ: Kenya: Politics of exclusion and inclusionFour other candidates were taken to task over the various aspects of the election process, with voter education dominating the separate sessions.Roseline Odede, who was the first to be interviewed, told the panel that if she replaces Issack Hassan, she will ensure the public has access to voter education materials.&quot;We have a substantial number of persons living with various forms of disabilities. Sadly most of them have been forgotten by IEBC as they are not considered in their activities, &quot; she said.I will ensure these special interest groups together with people in marginalised areas receive voter education materials in a language they understand.&quot;Ms Odede pledged to work with all stakeholders including political leaders and the public to restore faith in the institution.&quot;Bringing everyone on board and managing the elections well will reduce the lack of faith in IEBC,&quot; she explained, adding that treating all political parties equally will also restore public confidence.David Malakwen, a former company Secretary at the Kenya Commercial Bank, told the panel that he will involve community elders and religious leaders in voter education.

Using them to educate voters will definitely bear results,&quot; Mr Malakwen&nbsp;said.He explained that his first duty if he lands the job will be to hire a qualified and experienced Human Resource Manager.&quot;I will also conduct a lifestyle audit of all the staff including myself and make the results public. Credibility of an institution is lost when things are done in secrecy,&quot; he argued.Margaret Shava, another candidate, said she will reach out to non-governmental organisations and other well-wishers to complement the commission&#39;s efforts of educating the public.She, however, noted IEBC will take the lead in voter education, adding that if selected she will ensure all voters are reached.Ms Shava denied claims that she is related to a top Government officer.&quot;I read the story too on social media. I want to put the record straight that I am not related to the individual by blood, marriage or by any stretch of imaginations, &quot; she emphasised.

I believe more services can be devolved to an extent that is possible to serve the public better,&quot;Dr Kangu said.On Monday, five applicants for the IEBC chairperson position were grilled.They include former Mombasa mayor Taib Ali Taib, Florence Mwangangi, Wanyonyi Chebukati, Tukero ole Kina and Lucas Naikuni.From the nine people who were interviewed, the selection panel is supposed to come up with the names of two individuals which will be forwarded to President Uhuru Kenyatta to choose from as the next IEBC Chairperson.
