Turkana and Pokot leaders have asked CORD leader Raila Odinga not to call for national mass actions over a stalemate on the proposed changes to electoral laws.The leaders said the demonstrations may plunge the country into chaos. Turkana Senator John Munyes said the changes will work in favour of the pastoralist communities who have been suffering from network hitch.&quot;We must pass this Bill by all means at the Senate. We are telling our friends in CORD to accept the changes,&quot; he said.
