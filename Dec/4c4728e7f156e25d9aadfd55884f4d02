The diet offered should be balanced and should include a variety of foods. This is important to ensure your child gets the different nutrients he/she needs.Allergies: ALSO READ: School children&rsquo;s daily struggles in hostile public transport systemInform the school management in-case your child has any food allergies. It is also important to have a conversation with your child pertaining the same. Let them know the danger of consuming foods they are allergic to and if possible, remind them of the symptoms of such reactions so that they are also aware.Vitamin Supplementation and De-worming:First time school kids are mostly below five years old, meaning they are still eligible for routine child welfare clinic check-ups, during which they are given vitamin supplements, including Vitamin A.Ensure you continue these check-ups since your child is now more exposed to infections while in school. Ensuring regular de-worming (every three months) for your child will further help protect him or her from intestinal parasites that are common among school going children.
