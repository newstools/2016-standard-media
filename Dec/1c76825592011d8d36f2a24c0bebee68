Hopes that the ongoing health workers&rsquo; strike would be called off were dashed after another meeting between the doctors&rsquo; union and the Government failed to hammer out a deal yesterday.Many were hoping the strike that has paralysed public hospitals would be called off after&nbsp;Labour Cabinet Secretary Phyllis Kandie announced she was meeting Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) officials.&ldquo;Meeting with representatives of doctors to forge way forward,&rdquo; Ms Kandie said on her Twitter handle. However,&nbsp;KMPDU Secretary General Ouma Oluga confirmed they had met the CS but no agreement had been reached.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes we have met the Labour CS Kandie but no deal yet,&rdquo; Dr Oluga told The Standard yesterday as some doctors said they were ready to resign unless their demands, which also include promotions and the hiring of more health personnel to address a shortage, are met.This could worsen the current situation in which Kenya has been losing doctors to other countries offering better working terms.&nbsp;Oluga said no amount of intimidation would make them return to work, noting that this was ultimately for the benefit of Kenyans even as the strike entered its second week.Kenya currently has about 4,000 public sector doctors serving a population of about 40 million, meaning one serves up to 10,000 people, which goes against the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s recommendation of one doctor per 2,800 people.But the&nbsp;National Health Workforce report puts the number of people one doctor in Kenya serves at 6,000.Brain drain is a problem Kenya has grappled with since independence. This was alluded to during the striking doctors&#39; meeting at Railways Club in Nairobi yesterday, when they maintained that they would not go back to work until the CBA was implemented.Harvey Mulei, the Lower Eastern Kenya KMPDU chairman, said most doctors only stayed until they had cleared their Governments loans before taking off.&ldquo;Kenya trains about 700 doctors yearly yet we only have 4,000. Where are the rest going?&rdquo; said Dr Mulei.Hamisi Mwachonda, the KMPDU deputy secretary general, noted that Kenya had been losing doctors massively.&ldquo;We have lost most of our experienced doctors because they get better offers outside the country,&rdquo; he said.
