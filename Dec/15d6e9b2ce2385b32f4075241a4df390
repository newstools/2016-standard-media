Nigerian teen who spent her life in a plastic bowl because of a mysterious condition that stopped her arms and legs developing has died on Christmas Day, according to Daily Mail.Tragic Rahma Haruna, 19, story went viral after a picture of her being carried in a bowl by her 10-year-old brother Fahad was published online. Haruna, from Kano, Nigeria, was born a healthy baby but at six months old her growth came to a sudden halt and she stopped hitting key development milestones.Photojournalist Sani Maikatanga, who first shared her photos online, took to social media to announce her death.&nbsp;RIP. Allah ya ji kan ki Rahama. I met Rahama in January 10, 2016. We flew to Kano after @maikatanga_photography posted a picture of her on his page. I didn&#39;t meet with Rahama for any reason other than she was an extraordinary human that needed someone to listen and to act on issues at hand. We kept contact with Rahama via @maikatanga_photography..So many people including Ali Jita came from far and wide to meet with her family. She is one of the most pleasant people I have met this year. We continue to pray for strength within her family. Rahama died yesterday on Christmas Day! Cc @i_rabbi (management)A video posted by Di&#39;Ja (@aphrodija) on Dec 26, 2016 at 4:35am PST RIP.
