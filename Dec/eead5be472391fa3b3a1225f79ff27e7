Plans to ship in three million bags of subsidised fertiliser are underway.National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) Managing Director Newton Terer said the government will acquire 150,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser expected to arrive at the end of January for the next season of maize planting. Nonetheless, farmers would have to seek alternative source of fertiliser since the country has a requirement of 10-12 million bags.&quot;The three million bags of fertiliser is between 30 and 40 per cent of the fertiliser requirement in the country,&quot; said Mr Terer.The NCPB managing director also said they have Sh6 billion to purchase at least two millions bags of maize from farmers across the country.
