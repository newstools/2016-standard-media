A former ODM pointman in Gusii says he quit the party after it frustrated his candidature for a seat in the East Africa Legislative Assembly (EALA).&nbsp; Joseph Kiangoi, who has since shifted alliance to Jubiliee Party, said it took President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s intervention to secure him a popular vote in parliament that saw him join the regional assembly after the 2013 elections. According to Kiangoi, ODM had, as an afterthought, decided to back another candidate who CORD parliamentarians lobbied for after ditching him. Kiangoi is now Uhuru&#39;s point-man in Nyamira.
