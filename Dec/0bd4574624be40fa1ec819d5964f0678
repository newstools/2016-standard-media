A security expert who has announced his bid for Meru governor&#39;s seat in 2017 has accused Jubilee Party leaders in Meru of excluding his Republican Council Party from recent elections, thus putting him at a disadvantage.&nbsp;Mwenda Mbijjiwe who will wrestle for the Jubilee Party ticket with Senator Kiraitu Murungi and Kilemi Mwiria, said officials recently elected were pro-Kikali, an acronym for Kiraitu, Mithika Linturi (Igembe South MP) and Florence Kajuju, the Woman rep. The three leaders have teamed up with area MPs, MCAs and other leaders keen on defeating Governor Peter Munya in 2017, but Mbijjiwe said it appeared as if the Kikali had taken up all leadership positions of the recently-unveiled party on whose ticket President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto will gun for re-election in 2017.&quot;I am in Jubilee but if you look at the new officials you will notice they are allies of Kikali. JP in Meru is Kikali. It is only Jubilee Party elsewhere but not Meru,&quot; Mbijjiwe claimed on Thursday when he addressed supporters during a Thanksgiving Christmas party at Equator, Central Imenti.Mbijjiwe, a renowned consultant on security issues threatened to walk out on Jubilee if free and fair nominations were not assured by the top echelons of the JP.

My party, the Republican Council, was not invited. I have written to JP headquarters but I doubt they will do anything about the fact that all the top positions went to one party,&quot; said Mbijjiwe, in reference to Senator Kiraitu&#39;s Alliance Party of Kenya.&nbsp;&quot;If we are not assured of a fair nomination process I will ship out of the JP. I am determined to beat Kikali (Kiraitu) at the nomination and concentrate on beating Munya,&quot; said Mbijjiwe.
