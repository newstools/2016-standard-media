Stakeholders have called for political consensus to iron out the grey areas in the Elections Law (Amendments) Bill, 2015.The Bill that was passed by the National Assembly last week has generated political heat as sharp divisions emerged between the Government side and the Opposition. Presenting their views to the Senate Legal Committee chaired by Busia Senator Amos Wako, the stakeholders said if dialogue was not given a chance, the country might be headed for chaotic elections.Isaac Okero, the president of the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), said a restoration of the process of bipartisan participation was the only solution to avoiding the uncertainty that threatens to taint preparations for the 2017 elections.&quot;It is the absence of bipartisan consensus that is leading to mistrust and suspicion in the proposed amendment to Section 44 of the Elections Act with the introduction of Section 44A that creates a complementary mechanism for identification of voters and transmission of results but does not define the term complementary,&quot; Mr Okero said.

LSK supports electronic and biometric systems that promote trust and honesty in elected governments,&quot; Okero said.Ezra Chiloba, the chief executive of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), said the deadlock could only be resolved if parties held an honest and candid conversation.&quot;It should be on record that when the new laws were enacted, the IEBC was never consulted and indeed the general public. This is understood given the political context at the time the laws were negotiated,&quot; Mr Chiloba said.&quot;We have always advocated for a bipartisan approach in resolving these issues. Now that the Bill is before the Senate, we call for the same bipartisan approach,&quot; the CEO said.Kenya Private Sector Alliance board member Jeremy Awori called on the political leaders to put the country first by amicably resolving election-related disagreements.&quot;We need a country where business thrives so that we can grow the economy and employ our youth. This calls for dialogue to solve the current political stand-off,&quot; he said.
