This column, being my last one of 2016, finds me in a rather pensive mood.And with deference to the reflective space I am in, I will make a departure from its usual tenor. Not because there isn&rsquo;t an ever-increasing number of injustices, absurdities and grandstanding that we continue to be exposed to, nor because I am tired of fighting or occupying my hallowed position on the soapbox.Normal programming resumes next week.For now, though, I&rsquo;m going to shift the attention to ourselves and how we are allowing the circumstances around us to influence the very essence of ourselves as a people. Let&rsquo;s talk about playing the victim. ALSO READ: The disease of corruption hits Kenya&rsquo;s health sector hardestI am not referring to the unfortunate incidents for which the circumstances are largely out of our control, where we just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.My interest is in those spaces we willingly and wilfully take ourselves to, in the hope that we will magically reap something that we did not sow, and then turning around and declaring ourselves the victim.The interesting thing about being in a position where things &lsquo;happen to us&rsquo; is that it absolves us of personal responsibility and allows us to cede control to someone else or factors outside of our influence.As in years past, the scams get more and more ingenuous be it on the political, religious or money front.And whether it is &lsquo;panda mbegu&rsquo;, gambling ourselves into millions or the latest real estate scams, there&rsquo;s always one thing at the back our minds &mdash; that partaking in a scheme hatched up by someone else is the magic pill that will take us into that perfect, rich existence that we so deserve.So we sit back and rub our hands in glee, counting the days until we come into that small fortune. Then when it all comes crumbling down, we declare ourselves victims.I forget how many times we have heard all the cautionary tales, yet we still think this is our lucky break, that we can beat the odds, make a quick buck, become instant millionaires. ALSO READ: The disease of corruption hits Kenya&rsquo;s health sector hardestWhen the religious &lsquo;panda mbegu&rsquo; scandals broke and the media reported it, I, like every sane Kenyan, thought people would shun the churches that were spreading this gospel, excuse the pun.Alas, when the next worship cycle came round, I heard that it was packed to over-capacity.There is a chance that those who decided to pay a visit were there to assuage their curiosity and not because they were ardent converts but somehow I doubt that.Just the other day we saw a man of God, or so he claimed, exhibiting the most debased acts in a church, all in the name of healing.I hear the church is still flourishing.I do not mean to pick on places of worship, but there is something that comes with those who invoke the name of God that causes us to lose all reason and exhibit the most inane gullibility.We buy ostentatious items for those who claim to &lsquo;intercede&rsquo; for us. Yet we continue struggling under the yoke of poverty under the ruse that they have a more direct line of connection to our maker than we do. And then we claim that we have been duped, that we are victims.
