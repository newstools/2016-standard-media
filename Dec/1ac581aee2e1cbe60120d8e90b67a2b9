Opposition leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s key allies have begun to prep up for Orange Democratic Movement&rsquo;s (ODM) primaries in the party&rsquo;s strongholds in the indeterminate future.While some of the incumbents in the party will be taking on well-established opponents, a good number will face off against leaders who are less well known but have a strong grassroots network and appeal. Some of those in race for governorships are party chairman John Mbadi, Kisumu Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o and Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. Mr Mbadi, who is the Suba MP, will be up against Raila&rsquo;s former Chief of Staff Caroli Omondi, who said that despite the party&rsquo;s history of flawed nominations, he felt confident enough to secure the ODM nomination even though he is running against the party&rsquo;s chairman.&ldquo;I am not worried about the ticket,&rdquo; Omondi insisted, in anticipation of a bruising battle against Mbadi who believes some of the projects he initiated in Suba Constituency will work in his favour during the vote.Mbadi, who is among trusted Raila&rsquo;s allies with a national profile owing to his party position, is keen to ensure that the party he nominally presides over holds credible primaries.

The truth is that when I was elected in 2013, I had no position in the party,&rdquo; said Mohammed.Pesa, who narrowly lost to Junet in 2013, says he is ready to reclaim the parliamentary seat he once held.

You remember it was because of Ojaamong that Dr Otuoma resigned from ODM before changing his mind and returning to the fold several months later,&rdquo; said Tom Okidia, an ODM delegate from Busia.&ldquo;He was under the impression that Raila would favour Ojaamong in the gubernatorial contest,&rdquo; said Okidia.Other Raila allies facing stiff competition are Kisii Governor James Ongwae who is expected to battle it out with Senator Chris Obure for a ticket to contest the governorship. ODM has in the past send it would hold primaries in its strongholds but directly nominate candidates in areas it does not hold much sway to minimise the cost of running its party nominations.
