Intrigues surrounding the Sh791 million National Youth Service (NYS) scandal now threaten to engulf Parliament amid bitter exchanges between members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that is investigating the scandal. The oversight committee chairman Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda) Thursday sought sanctions against fellow member John Mbadi (Suba) for implying that the committee has been compromised. Leader of Majority Aden Duale (Garissa Town) added more fuel into the raging fires when he claimed that two companies associated with Mr Mbadi received NYS money and challenged PAC to investigate the two companies. Gumbo and Duale fired salvos at Mbadi, who has publicly denounced the committee investigations and asserted that powerful forces within and outside Parliament are working overtime to compromise investigations into the scandal. Proceedings a sham Mbadi pointed to alleged failure by the committee to invite Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Farouk Kibet, an aide of Deputy President William Ruto, as evidence that the committee proceedings are a sham. The two were named by former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru as among those that benefitted from the NYS loot.
