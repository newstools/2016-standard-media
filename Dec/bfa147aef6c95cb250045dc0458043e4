Church leaders have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta not to assent to elections law amendment if it is approved by the Senate.Eldoret Catholic Archdiocese Bishop Cornelius Korir said the Elections Laws (Amendment) Bill of 2016 was a recipe for violence. Bishop Korir said the bill, which was unanimously passed in the National Assembly by Jubilee-affiliated MPs after their CORD counterparts walked out in protest, undermines the constitutional requirement for public participation.The outspoken cleric slammed the Jubilee leadership for going against the resolutions made by the special joint parliamentary committee on Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) reforms chaired by senators James Orengo (Siaya) and Kiraitu Murungi (Meru), which he noted involved public views.&ldquo;It is sad that after the agreement, Jubilee is going against the agreements prompting the Opposition to feel betrayed hence their intentions to plan for mass actions next year. All these decisions are not good for the country,&rdquo; he said.
