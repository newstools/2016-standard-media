Exactly one year after the sudden death of KTN Swahili anchor Ahmed Darwesh, his colleagues Wednesday recounted how he impacted their lives positively. The Standard photographer Peter Ochieng based in Eldoret said Darwesh&#39;s death was a loss of not only a colleague but a true friend. &quot;One day I went to the Nairobi office for a one-day assignment and had just travelled in the night with no clothes to change. When I was planning to travel back, Darwesh came and convinced me to stay at his place and get to know his family,&quot; said Ochieng. North Rift KTN reporter Elvis Kosgei recounted his moments with Darwesh, whom he said mentored him. Lucas Ng&#39;asike, The Standard reporter, said he met Darwesh during a job assignment in Lodwar and was struck by his humility.
