Hundreds of mourners yesterday attended the burial of a 58-year-old widow and her five grandchildren who died in a house fire. The family from Challani village in Kaloleni constituency died after the house they were sleeping in was razed last week. The bodies of Sidi Mweni, Baraka Kalume, 8, Furaha Tsofa, 6, one-and-a-half-year-old twins Pauline Charo and Nancy Charo and Ibra Mweni also aged one and half were buried in a mass grave. Religious leaders accused the county government of abandoning widows. The county&#39;s pastors&#39; fellowship co-ordinator Jembe Lewa asked the county government to create a department to look after the needs of widows. Rev Lewa said the victim widow was staying in a non-conducive environment that may have led to the tragedy.

Some things can be avoided if the community and government come together to look into the needs of widows. If this is not solved, we will always make the same mistake,&quot; said Lewa.
