Emerging market stocks edged higher yesterday, but currencies struggled for direction after manufacturing data painted a mixed picture for developing economies while the prospect of rising oil prices and a weaker dollar provided some support.Data from China showed manufacturing in the world&rsquo;s second- largest economy grew more than expected in November because of government building projects and a housing boom.The mood was still being buoyed, though, by gains of nearly 10 per cent in oil prices after OPEC agreed its first output cut since 2008. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s Purchasing Manager Index coming in stronger than expected is a key one - China has such a huge impact on emerging markets, it affects general risk sentiment, and when things look okay in China it boosts confidence in the rest of emerging markets,&rdquo; said Per Hammarlund, strategist at SEB.
