&nbsp;CORD leader Raila Odinga and his Amani National Congress party counterpart Musalia Mudavadi Wednesday completed their tour of Mt Kenya region with a plea to residents to reject Jubilee. Speaking after a rousing welcome in the Jubilee stronghold of Kathwana market in Tharaka Nithi County, the two accused the Jubilee government of excelling in branding the Embu and Meru as cousins of the Kikuyu for political expediency.&quot;After the General Election is over, the region reverts to being called Mt Kenya East and is no longer part of the larger Mt Kenya,&quot; Raila claimed.Their tour of Tharaka Nithi came after visits to Laikipia and Nyeri counties on Tuesday and earlier Wednesday. At the Aberdare Country Club, Raila consulted briefly with elders and a group of squatters who were preparing a petition to hand over to him about an unsuccessful pledge to resettle them.

With them were their senior party officials with roots in the area such as Langata Ward MCA David Mberia, who is also the Nairobi Majority Chief Whip.Raila also received Gatunga Ward MCA Peter Mwago into ODM after he was introduced by the party&#39;s Meru patron, Mike Makerana.&quot;I have come here today after hearing your cry of distress,&quot; Raila said. &quot;If Jubilee cannot solve a problem in its backyard, we wish to tell you to try us because we can do it.&quot;The two urged residents to vote for the Opposition, accusing Jubilee of hoodwinking Kenyans with non-existent projects. He said there was no evidence on the ground to show that 10,000km of roads had been tarred by the Government since 2013, or that the Last Mile electric power connections had reached as many Kenyans as claimed.
