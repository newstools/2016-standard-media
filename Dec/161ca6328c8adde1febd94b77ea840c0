Two people were killed when part of a two-storey building in a police training college collapsed in Nigeria&#39;s commercial capital Lagos on Sunday, the police and the emergency agency said.The collapse happened at about 04:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) in the densely populated Ikeja district of the city, an official from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said. &quot;Two people lost their lives. Nobody is inside the rubble,&quot; said Dolapo Badmus, a spokesman for Lagos state police. Both he and the NEMA official said the search for other people was over.Building collapses are frequent in Africa&#39;s most populous nation and often blamed by officials on the use of cheap materials.On Dec. 11, more than 100 people were killed when a church collapsed in the southeast of the country.
