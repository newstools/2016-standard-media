NAIROBI, KENYA: Suba Member of Parliament on Friday denied links to the National Youth Service mega scandal. This is after Jubilee Majority Leader Adan Duale claimed that a company associated with Mbadi undertook business deals with the now discredit National Youth Service. &ldquo;I wish to assure Kenyans that I have never done any business with the NYS personally or through my companies,&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;Of the two companies Mr. Duale mentioned, I only have association with Takawiri Limited.
