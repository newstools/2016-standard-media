Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) has met key sub-contractors of the Sh48 billion Mombasa-Nairobi pipeline to fast-track its completion by April.At the KPC head office Thursday, the firm&rsquo;s management had talks with representatives of Straccom Engineering, Quality Inspectors Ltd and Dynamic Green Technologies to review the contract with the main contractor, Zakhem. KPC Managing Director Joe Sang said the meeting also addressed any technical and financial challenges the three subcontractors may be facing.&ldquo;The decision to engage the sub-contractors directly was to get a first-hand appraisal about progress as well as address any potential challenges to ensure the pipeline project is on track,&rdquo; said Mr Sang.One of the challenges being addressed is support services to the sub-contractors while on site.The board has slated another meeting with the main contractor as it sets April next year as the time within which the project should be complete.The State-owned company says the overall project completion is at 68 per cent while construction of the actual pipeline is 90 per cent done.The focus now is on construction and installation of equipment at the new pump stations.The 450km pipeline is expected to enhance KPC&rsquo;s supply of petroleum products across the country and replace the current line that was constructed in 1978.This will in turn increase supply of the product to Nairobi before feeding it into spur lines connecting to the rest of the country.Data from Petroleum Institute of East Africa shows that last year, Kenya consumed 5.9 billion litres of petroleum products compared to 4 billion litres in 2010.KPC projects that its completion will remove about 700 trucks from the roads daily to save the Government the cost of road maintenance occasioned by heavy loads.Straccom Engineering is carrying out civil works for Nairobi Terminal while Quality Inspectors Ltd is charged with radiography testing for mainline construction.Civil works for Embakasi are being handled by Dynamic Green Technologies.
