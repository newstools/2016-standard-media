The body of a 12-year-old girl who went missing on Saturday evening was found dumped near a river in Getare, Kisii town. The family of the orphaned girl, Cynthia Mayaka, had searched for the Standard Six girl for the better part of Saturday night only for them to find her body yesterday morning. Residents suspected that the girl might have been defiled before being murdered. The body lay in a pool of blood. The girl had been living with her grandmother following the death of her parents years ago. The grandmother had sent her to buy milk from a neighbour but she failed to return home. The family said the victim left home around 4pm on Saturday with a two-litre can to buy milk but they grew worried when she failed to return by 7pm. The body was found by an elderly man cutting napier grass on his farm on Sunday morning.
