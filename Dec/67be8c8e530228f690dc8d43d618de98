The burial of former Kitui mayor Martha Mwangangi was yesterday disrupted for close to two hours after angry mourners demanded that Governor Julius Malombe be ejected.The former was killed last week when a county government fire engine run over her during a protest against demolition of kiosks by the county administration. The burial ceremony turned chaotic for soon after Mr Malombe and his wife Edith arrived at Mwangangi&rsquo;s home in Kyanika village in Kitui East constituency.Trouble began when Malombe arrived in the company of a group of uniformed and plain-clothes security aides.He was however barred from entering the compound and the gate closed on him as stones were hurled at him by the angry mourners.

The governor only left after Kitui Catholic Bishop Anthony Muheria implored on him to do so.Amid the confusion, Mwangangi&rsquo;s body was removed from the podium and taken into the house as local leaders and the police tried to diffuse the tension.Former Cabinet minister Charity Ngilu, Senator David Musila and MPs Makali Mulu (Kitui Central), Marcus Muluvi (Kitui East), Charles Nyamai (Kitui Rural) and Bishop Robert Mutemi (Nominated) as well as Tip Tip leader Kalembe Ndile were also ushered into the house.After Malombe left, Mwangangi&rsquo;s remains were returned to the podium and the ceremony went on undisrupted.&ldquo;This is unacceptable. Malombe cannot force himself into an event he is not wanted. We can forgive but we will not forget this sad affair. Mwangangi&rsquo;s death would not be in vain. The killer(s) will be punished,&rdquo; Ngilu said. Musila urged County Commissioner Boaz Cherutich to allow public inquest to expose those behind Mwangangi&rsquo;s killing.
