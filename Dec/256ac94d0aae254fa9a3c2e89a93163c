A doctor in Kisumu temporarily withdrew from the ongoing strike to rescue an abandoned four-year-old child.The baby was abandoned by her parents at a county hospital six months ago.Kisumu County Hospital Medical Superintendent Amos Otedo told reporters that a doctor at the facility took Baby Hope into his private care after her plight was highlighted in The Standard yesterday. The child had been left unattended following the nationwide strike by medics.Dr Otedo, however, did not divulge details of whether the doctor was only taking care of the baby during the strike period or planned to adopt her.&quot;The girl is in safe hands. She was taken by one of the doctors,&quot; said Otedo in response to our inquiries on the child that was left alone in the paediatric ward after parents transferred their children from the health facility.He also clarified that it is not the hospital that had abandoned the child, but her parents.Otedo said Baby Hope was admitted to the paediatric ward and nurses assigned to watch over her. This was after efforts to trace her parents failed.She had stunted growth and was being monitored at the facility.And in the same hospital, an elderly woman whose relatives have not been traced for three years refused to leave her bed in the medical ward.The woman, only referred to as Christine, went back to the medical ward when other patients were moved to the surgical ward.
