The University of Nairobi (UoN) has signed a deal with the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) to train legislators. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the university and the Centre for Parliamentary Studies and Training (CPST), a department of PSC, was signed yesterday. Speaking after the deal was sealed, Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi said the partnership will transform CPST, the capacity building arm of Parliament, into a leading regional hub for capacity building in areas of legislative studies and diplomacy. &quot;We are proud because we are getting into a legal engagement with the very best university not only in Kenya but the whole region. With the status of UoN , we know CPST will gain a lot from research capacity of the university,&quot; said Mr Muturi. University of Nairobi Vice Chancellor Peter Mbithi said the institution, through its Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies, was committed to meeting its obligation. Prof Mbithi explained that establishing partnerships was part of the key pillars of the university as it is in line with its strategic plans.
