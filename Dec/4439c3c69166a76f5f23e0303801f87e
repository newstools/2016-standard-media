President Uhuru Kenyatta has accused the Opposition of trying to dictate how the next general election should be conducted.Reacting to Tuesday&#39;s acrimonious special session of the National Assembly that ended in disarray, Uhuru said the Government was committed to ensuring the election is free, fair and peaceful. &quot;I want to make it clear that we will not let a few people dictate how elections will be conducted next year. Independent, Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is an independent body that must be left to do its work independently,&quot; he said.Speaking in Thika town after opening a Volkswagen vehicle assembly plant, Uhuru said the Opposition had no agenda for building and developing the country apart from insults.He declared that no amount of threats and intimidation from the Opposition would distract his government from discharging its mandate.

I&#39;m a citizen of this country. Let us make laws that will make this country safe for everyone,&quot; said Mr Ng&#39;eno. ALSO READ:Kenya stops American organisation from educating voters &nbsp;
