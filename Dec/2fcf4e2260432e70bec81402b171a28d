A youthful businessman-cum-politician Leonard Muriuki has declared interest in the Embu governorship. This brings the number of aspirants seeking to unseat incumbent Martin Wambora to six. Mr Muriuki has declared his bid on a Jubilee Party ticket. &quot;As a youthful person, I want to inject fresh thinking into Embu politics. We have suffered under-development due to divisive politics by leaders who are there,&quot; he said Thursday. Others who have shown interest in the seat are Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti, Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire, former Transport Permanent Secretary Cyrus Njiru, World Bank consultant Kithinji Kiragu and psychiatrist Peter Kumantha.
