Drama erupted in an Eldoret Court when the wife of prominent former politician suddenly began screaming in the middle of divorce proceedings.Josephine Jepkoech, 68, who has been married to Jackson Kibor, 82, for 51 years, had appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Charles Obulutsa to continue with a cross-examination in a case where her husband wants to divorce her. Mr Kibor went to court on June 17, 2014, seeking to divorce Ms Jepkoech on claims of desertion, cruelty and denial of conjugal rights. His wife has denied the claims and insists their marriage, which bore seven children, is blissful.In a sudden twist of events, Jepkoech took to the dock to protest that she was unwell and unable to continue with her defence.This prompted Kibor&rsquo;s lawyer, Mark Waziri, to question the genuineness of her claim.

It is unfair of her to say this when she is already in the dock. We are concerned about the unnecessary causes of adjournment in this matter,&rdquo; said Mr Waziri.Following some insisting by Waziri and an agitated Kibor, Jepkoech suddenly let out a shrill scream and, turning to her husband, demanded to know why she was being forced to testify when she was unwell.&ldquo;I have serious stomach complications that have troubled me for a while and I am on medication. I am not in a position to testify yet you do not want to understand. What wrong did I do in this world or to you?&rdquo; Jepkoech asked.&nbsp;SHRILL CRYTo which Kibor responded: &ldquo;Can a sick person make such a shrill cry? Why didn&rsquo;t she say she was unwell earlier so the matter could be rescheduled?&rdquo;It took the intervention of Mr Obulutsa to calm the situation, ruling that anyone had the right to seek another date to appear and/or testify in court if they were indeed unwell and unable to continue testifying.Kibor, who was clearly uncomfortable with the development, insisted that he would settle for nothing less than a divorce from his second wife and would not be compromised by what he described as delaying tactics.
