&nbsp;{Photo:Courtesy}Brussels: NATO will seek to reassure Russia on Monday that its troop deployments to the Baltics and Poland next year are purely defensive, in a rare meeting of the alliance&#39;s envoys with those of the Kremlin that is unlikely to resolve long-standing grievances. The NATO-Russia Council, the forum bringing together North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ambassadors and Russia&#39;s top diplomat dealing with the U.S.-led alliance, will convene for only the third time this year with the crisis in Ukraine still the top concern for Brussels and Washington.Russia says it is concerned about a NATO military build-up near its borders. &quot;We count on having a frank discussion about the security situation in Europe ... including ... the consequences of NATO reinforcements on the eastern flank,&quot; Russia&#39;s ambassador to NATO, Alexander Grushko, said on Friday.With relations already at a low ebb, Russia&#39;s devastating bombing campaign in Aleppo, which is not expected to be formerly discussed, has provided a dark backdrop for the meeting, diplomats said.

Moscow denies that, saying the violence in Ukraine&#39;s industrial east that has killed more than 10,000 people is the result of a civil war.One senior NATO diplomat told Reuters that there was little chance of a breakthrough, particularly as the alliance waits for the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to take office in January.

There is a chance of a total change in policy,&quot; the diplomat said, citing concern among European allies about Trump&#39;s conciliatory approach toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.However, one hope is that NATO and Russia could discuss common rules to handle unexpected military encounters along one another&#39;s borders in the air and at sea as both sides intensify their military exercises.&quot;It is imperative that we establish a framework for handling encounters between opposing militaries and the civilian aircraft and ships operating in their midst,&quot; said John McColl, former NATO deputy supreme allied commander in Europe and now at the London-based European Leadership Network think-tank.
