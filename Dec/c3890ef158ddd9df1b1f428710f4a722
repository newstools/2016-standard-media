The country was on April 26 plunged into mourning following the death of former First Lady Lucy Kibaki in a London hospital.She had been admitted at Bupa Cromwell Hospital for specialised treatment. Her death put out the light on the controversial history of a mother who fiercely protected her family from negative publicity; one who in full force attacked things she disliked or found demeaning to her husband, her social standing or family unit.President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a statement announcing the death of the former First Lady. It came to light that even though the first call informing the family of Ms Kibaki&rsquo;s death came in at 7am, the family waited for President Kenyatta to break the sad news at 11.38am in line with protocol regarding a former First Lady.&ldquo;Her Excellency will be remembered for her immense contribution in the development of our country. Especially notable were her virtues of leadership and commitment to improving the well-being of the ordinary Kenyans, in particular her focus on tackling HIV and Aids, which will remain an inspiration to many,&rdquo; the President said in a statement.
