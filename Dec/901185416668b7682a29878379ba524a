Nyatike MP Omondi Anyanga has warned that cases of political violence were hurting ODM leader Raila Odinga&#39;s presidential bid. Fears of campaign-related violence and misuse of social media, he said, could lead to massive voter apathy in the August 2017 General Election. &quot;We should show some respect to Raila&#39;s quest for the top job. When we fight in front of him, we portray that we are irresponsible. The least we can do is to abhor violence,&quot; said Anyanga. Anyanga, who also chairs Migori Parliamentary Group, said political parties and law enforcement agencies should move with speed and rein in politicians who resort to intimidating rivals. He said ODM strongholds were fast becoming prone to chaos and called for political sobriety.

This is the time they should be forming forums to discuss issues they want addressed in their areas rather than plotting unorthodox means to gain undue advantage ahead of party nominations,&quot; he said. Speaking to the press, Anyanga said the culture of violence, if allowed to continue, will compromise the integrity of next year&#39;s polls, adding that hooliganism was fuelling mistrust among political players. &quot;Propaganda on social media will not take this country forward. We have situations where rivals take to social media to spread hate messages which only breed discontent,&quot; said Anyanga. He cited a case in Migori where supporters of a gubernatorial candidate, Ochillo Ayacko, and the incumbent governor, Okoth Obado, clashed on Saturday, leaving scores injured. Violence also broke out during a memorial event for former Homa Bay Senator Otieno Kajwang in Mbita, which saw Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma and his rival Washington Ogaga engage in a fist fight. Anyanga wants the police to move in and curb the violence. ALSO READ: Another stalemate on IEBC is uncalled-for, time&rsquo;s not on our side
