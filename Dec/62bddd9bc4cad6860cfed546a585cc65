TOKYO:&nbsp;Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#39;s visit to Pearl Harbour this month may not be the first by a sitting Japanese premier but will be the first with a U.S. president, his top government spokesman said on Thursday, trying to clarify confusion over the trip. Abe announced on Monday he would join President Barack Obama on a Dec. 26-27 visit to the site of the Japanese surprise attack 75 years ago that drew the United States into World War Two. A foreign ministry official said on Monday that Abe would be the first incumbent Japanese leader to visit. But media this week said that back in September 1951 then-Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida stopped by Pearl Harbor en route from San Francisco. When asked about this, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters the government could not confirm exactly where Yoshida visited. &quot;Then-prime minister Yoshida visited Honolulu in 1951 and at that time he honoured the war dead at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific,&quot; Suga said.

The two leaders hope to showcase the strength of the security alliance between the two former wartime foes.&nbsp; READ: Japan PM Abe seeks to build trust with Trump, stresses alliance vital
