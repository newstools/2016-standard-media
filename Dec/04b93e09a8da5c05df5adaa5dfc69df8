Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery has revealed 90 criminal gangs, saying that members of such illegal groups would be arrested and charged in court.Prevention of Organised Crimes Act, 2010 spells out tough measures to deal with criminal gangs by imposing jail terms ranging from 14 years to life imprisonment for those found guilty. It also provides a harsh penalty for anyone who fundraises, organises or directs members of a criminal gang to commit a serious crime and/or for those taking or administering oath as they are liable upon conviction to life imprisonment. In a gazette notice dated December 30, Nkaissery said he took the steps following advice of the Inspector General of police Joseph Boinnet.Among those named in the notice include the Gaza gang, which operates in Kayole, Superpower in Eastleigh and 42 Brothers, based in Eastlands, Acrobatic, Akapulo, Akili Za Usiku, American Marines, Bad Men, Black Latino, Bongo Rongo, Boston Boys, Bulanda Boys, Chapa Ilale, Chifu Kali, Chimoi Highway Gang, China Squad and Chini ya Mnazi.According to the notice, Mungiki seems to have changed its name to Eminants of Mungiki.
