A United Nations Development Programme initiative, the forum focuses on topical governance and peace building issues and seeks solutions on democracy, governance and elections in Africa.The speakers faulted political parties for failing to follow laid-down election rules.&quot;Political parties need to embrace a system of punishment for those who break the law,&quot; said Africa Policy Initiative president, Prof Peter Kagwanja.

The vetting of six applicants to replace outgoing chair Ahmed Isaack Hassan has also started.The experts warned that failure to rein in politicians who blatantly break the law is slowing progress on free and fair elections.Mrs Charllotte Osei, chairperson of Ghana&#39;s electoral commission, said her country faced similar challenges when conducting its general election earlier this month.Osei said her country adopted electoral reforms before the polls and quickly responded to any false rumours during the election period.
