Fraudsters in the Ministry of Lands IT department switched land documents to enable a firm to evict a family from their prime property.According to National Land Commission (NLC) officials, the forged documents used to appropriate the Kurji family home in Westlands, Nairobi, were filed on October 20 &ndash; a public holiday. The family was forcibly evicted from their Sh80 million property and their family home demolished in an early morning raid on Sunday, November 4, 2016.Unknown to the family, Frank Logistics owned by Francis Nyagah Njeru had, on October 20, 2016, been irregularly registered as proprietors of their home that sat on half an acre. City Hall distanced itself from the demolition, leading to the arrest of Mr Njeru, who was charged with fraud and malicious damage to property.

It was not immediately clear why the lease renewal took two years, offering other people a window to attempt to disinherit the family.
