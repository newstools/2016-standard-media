Politicians eyeing the gubernatorial seat on an ODM ticket have welcomed former assistant minister Chirau Mwakwere to the party. Mr Mwakwere, who is Kenya&#39;s high commissioner to Tanzania, met ODM leader Raila Odinga and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho in Nairobi early this month for discussions and returned to Dar es Salaam after presenting his campaign details to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The former Matuga MP was accompanied to the meeting by former Kinango MP Simon Mkalla who is his presumptive running mate &nbsp;as they seek to unseat Governor Salim Mvurya. Reports indicate Mwakwere will resign from Government next month to begin his campaigns. ODM has attracted six aspirants who include Issa Chipera, Kwale Speaker Sammy Ruwa, former Permanent Secretary Mohammed Mwachai, Nicholas Zani, Gereza Dena and&nbsp; Mwakwere. Speaking on behalf of the ODM gubernatorial aspirants at the Kinondo ODM office, Issa Chipera said there will be free and fair nominations and asked Mwakwere to prepare for stiff competition.
