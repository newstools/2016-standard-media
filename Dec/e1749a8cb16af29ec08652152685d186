President Uhuru Kenyatta will today lead Kenyans in marking the country&#39;s 53rd independence celebrations. This is against the backdrop of a Jubilee government struggling to reassure Kenyans that the fight against corruption is on track. Less than 10 months to the General Election, the Head of State is also expected to use the national platform to trumpet his Government&#39;s achievements and also plead for unity as Kenya approaches the electioneering period. During last year&#39;s Jamhuri Day celebrations, in which Uhuru challenged his critics to practice mature politics, he observed that &#39;corruption kills&#39; and promised to deal decisively with the vice. He was particularly furious with the Opposition for making &#39;unsubstantiated&#39; claims on the Eurobond saga.

Terrorists offer bribes hoping to cross our borders. Corruption kills,&quot; President Kenyatta said last year. &quot;Those who believe they are entitled to steal our resources will try to manipulate our political debate. Others will wring political capital from the fight against corruption. We will not defeat them unless we all keep our eyes on the prize &ndash; a country in which corruption is shunned,&quot; he had said. But since that speech, the Jubilee administration has moved from one crisis to another, the latest being the Sh5 billion Ministry of Health scandal. As the country approaches the polls, the image of a corrupt government where wheeler-dealers thrive on taxpayers&#39; money is one he would wish to dispel. Among the achievements the President is expected to highlight is the near completion of the Standard Gauge Railway on the Mombasa-Nairobi route and the launch of the second phase of the multi-billion shilling project. Uhuru is further set to highlight reforms in the education sector, including the Ministry of Education&#39;s feat of producing a clean examination for the first time in a generation.

The President is expected to plead for peaceful campaigns and also emphasise on mature politics. &quot;The President will use the occasion, as per established tradition, to confer honours on Kenyans, and other Africans, who have made outstanding contributions in various spheres of our development,&quot; said a statement from State House yesterday. Today&#39;s celebrations will also be graced by President of the Republic of Togo, Fare Essozimna Gnassingbe.
