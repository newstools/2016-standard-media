The latest development support&rsquo;s KRA&rsquo;s mission to become the country&rsquo;s principal revenue collector in the public sector.Upon implementation, Kiambu County will leverage on KRA&rsquo;s iTax platform that has the advantage of making payment through any of the commercial banks.Bension Korongo, the KRA Commissioner for Domestic Taxes said the agreement will increase revenue payment compliance, hence making it hard for defaulters to operate undetected.&ldquo;Upon full implementation, taxpayers will be availed the convenience of accessing their bills and make payment from the comfort of their premises via iTax, and even generate and print their permits.&rdquo; Korongo said.According to Korongo, the step taken by Kiambu County will eliminate revenue losses that it had experienced. Last year, Kiambu County collected Sh2.5 billion, which was Sh800 million short of its target.Kiambu Governor William Kabogo said the latest initiative was part of a raft of measures taken by his administration to improve on revenue collection. He said the measures also include extending amnesty for defaulters for an additional 30 days.&ldquo;After this period, we will release all records to KRA for onward processing. The amnesty is meant to enable owners with no records to formalise their books without incurring penalties,&rdquo; Kabogo said.
