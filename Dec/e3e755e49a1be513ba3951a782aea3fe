A health crisis is looming at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison following an&nbsp;outbreak of Hepatis B which has claimed one inmate and affected over 100 others.One inmate has been isolated after testing positive for Hepatitis C, which is more serious.The situation is grim as most of those with signs of Hepatitis B cannot be moved to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) for further treatment because of the ongoing medics&#39; strike. Henry Kisengu, the head of Kamiti Prison, said only eight cases had been referred to KNH.&quot;We are struggling but managing the crisis. It has worsened because we cannot transfer the patients to KNH. And other cases are being transferred from other precincts to Kamiti,&quot;&nbsp; said the prison boss.Mr Kisengu added that they had received medical help from the county government to tackle the outbreak.&quot;They all need to be vaccinated as part of efforts to contain the spread. Our fears are that the one with Hepatitis C may spread it. We are told it is more dangerous,&quot; he said.Authorities said there was another outbreak in Lodwar and&nbsp;Meru prisons but noted that a medical team had been dispatched to tackle it.Officials said they were investigating the source of the disease to contain its spread in the correctional facilities.Commissioner of Prisons Isaiah Osugo said they had traced the disease to Lodwar.&quot;We have mobilised our resources to contain any further spread of the disease. We hope the situation will be addressed as soon as possible,&quot; he said.Prison officials said the ongoing strike by doctors had complicated the situation as many inmates remained unattended.Nairobi County Health Executive Bernard Muia, whose officers in conjunction with the prison&#39;s Health department and the Ministry of Health are fighting to stop the spread, said 200 inmates had been vaccinated.&quot;As the county, we are assisting in screening, vaccination and health promotion activities,&quot; he said.The health officials intend to vaccinate all 1,500 members of staff and the more than 3,000 prisoners.
