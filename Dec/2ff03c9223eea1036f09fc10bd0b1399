The Senate on Wednesday will in a special session debate the contentious amendments on the Election Laws (Amendment Bill, 2015).The laws have been at the centre of a major fallout between the two main political rivals Jubilee and the Opposition. Jubilee MPs passed the amendments last week at the National Assembly during a chaotic session where Opposition MPs walked out en masse. Though in principle the changes look good, the way the ruling Jubilee coalition went about it has created a climate of suspicion and made the narrative of a sinister motive to stick.&nbsp;There were fist-fights, name-calling, the use of unsavoury language and unparliamentary behaviour as the august House descended into anarchy. The heavy presence of security officers within the precincts of the National Assembly and the unjustified media harassment didn&rsquo;t make matters any better.An aggrieved Opposition has now called for mass action starting next week.

Was the process mishandled?Senate Speaker Ekwe Ethuro has since called a special sitting of the Senate to discuss the changes. The Senate has in the past shown a measure of sobriety and been a force for the common good when debating national issues.Like when the country was faced with an impasse over the exit of IEBC commissioners it took a bi-partisan team led by senators Kiraitu Murungi and James Orengo to chart the way forward. We hope this will come to play again. We also hope that Kenyans will have the chance to follow the debate live and journalists will not be manhandled as happened last week.We want to share the enthusiasm of Mr Ethuro. His voice has often risen above the political din, creating consensus.We look to senators to rise above political overtones that have dominated the subject.&nbsp; ALSO READ: MP to undergo treatment in Germany after election laws chaos in Parliament
