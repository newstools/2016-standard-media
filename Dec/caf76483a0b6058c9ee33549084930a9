Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has started grilling senior leaders from Homa Bay over political violence that saw an MP and his opponent fight in public two weeks ago. The probe, which could see some leaders suspended from the party, comes at a time when tension is high in the county as it prepares to host party leader Raila Odinga on Sunday. Raila is due to attend the second edition of the Luo Festival and politicians are already recruiting youths to give them security and moral support during the event. The inaugural festival was held in Kisumu last year. Yesterday, ODM National Electoral Board Chairperson Judy Pareno confirmed her team had grilled Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti who had accused certain politicians of hiring youths to heckle him. Her deputy Hamilton Orata, Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, Homa Bay gubernatorial aspirant Enosh Bolo and Homa Bay Town parliamentary aspirant Washington Ogada who fought in public with area MP Opondo Kaluma were also questioned at Orange House.

The team has expanded the list of those to be questioned to include ODM youth leader Kevin Ouma and Central Karachuonyo MCA Julius Gaya. Mr Ouma alias Wau Wau was on Monday night arrested over claims he had an unlicensed gun but was later freed after it turned out to be a hoax.
