The auditor who blew the whistle on the Sh5 billion scandal at the Ministry of Health has been transferred in a major reshuffle of Government audit departments. Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich reshuffled at least 17 internal auditors in various ministries, one month after the health scam was reported. In the changes, Mr Rotich has moved Benard Muchere from the Head of Internal Audit at the Ministry of Health to the Internal Audit headquarters. Mr Muchere raised queries on irregular payments amounting to Sh5 billion at Afya House. The payments are currently under investigation by Government agencies. In documents seen by The Standard, George Mweresa has been moved from the Ministry of Education to Transport and Infrastructure as Head of Internal Audit. Moses Karanja moves from Agriculture to Industry while Francis Njau replaces Mr Muchere at Afya House as the Head of Internal Audit. Hosea Wasike and Joseph Onyera have been moved from the Internal Audit headquarters to the Agriculture ministry. Highly-placed sources at the Ministry of Health who spoke to The Standard in confidence said the transfer had caused panic and is being seen as direct victimisation of Muchere. The transfers came as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Senate and National Assembly health committees are still investigating whether the Ministry of Health misappropriated Sh5 billion. READ: Patients continue to suffer as salary talks collapse Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri contradicted his CS Cleopa Mailu when they appeared before the Senate committee regarding a letter allegedly written to National Treasury asking for Muchere&#39;s transfer. While Mailu said such a letter was written, Muraguri denied writing it. &quot;I asked for a senior qualified person, someone who was more conversant with bigger ministries. There are more senior persons than him,&quot; Muraguri told the committee. The letter written by Rotich indicates that the changes take effect from today.
