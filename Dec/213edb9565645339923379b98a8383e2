NYERI: Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit has called for the withdrawal of a civil suit pending before court that has stalled the process of electing a new Bishop for Mt Kenya Central Diocese. Speaking at St James Cathedral when he ordained new priests, Sapit said the matter pending in court was a stumbling block to the election of a bishop. &quot;The church has a defined process of electing bishops and the matter pending before court has frustrated the process forcing Mt Kenya Central to remain under a commissary reporting to the head of the church,&quot; said Sapit. The election has been stopped twice despite three candidates, Rev Timothy Gichere, Rev Wilson Burugu and Rev John Karumwa having been shortlisted to contest locking five others. The row emerged when some of the nominees alleged that the process was marred by intimidation and bribery. After the exercise failed to take place, the former archbishop Dr. Eliud Wabukala appointed Mt Kenya Central ACK Diocese assistant Bishop Allan Waithaka the commissary to be in charge until fresh elections are called.
