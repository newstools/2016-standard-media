Jubilee MPs yesterday pushed through major changes to the country&#39;s election laws in an acrimonious session of the House.The passage sets the stage for yet another round of political wars between Jubilee and the Opposition as the country heads to the next General Election. Jubilee, smarting from Monday&#39;s failed attempt, succeeded just a day after holding a parliamentary group meeting where the legislators were given clear instructions to pass the changes.The changes to the Elections Laws (Amended) Act allows the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to come up with a manual system of transmitting results and voter identification, a provisions opposed by CORD on grounds that the ruling coalition is setting the stage for rigging the polls.&quot;Notwithstanding the provisions of section 44, the commission shall put in place a complementary mechanism for identification and transmission of results that is simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent to ensure that the commission complies with the provisions of Article 38 of the Constitution,&quot; reads the amendment passed in the National Assembly.
