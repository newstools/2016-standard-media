A recent headline designating Kenya&rsquo;s health sector as the most corrupt, reminded me this is a global cancer &mdash; after all, corruption has been described as a disease.When corruption infiltrates global health, it can be particularly devastating, threatening hard gained improvements in human and economic development, international security, and population health. Yet, the multifaceted and complex nature of global health corruption makes it extremely difficult to tackle, despite its enormous costs, estimated in billions of dollars. Similar to cancer, health-related corruption comes in several types: From &lsquo;petty&rsquo; corruption such as absenteeism of healthcare workers to &lsquo;systematic&rsquo; corruption involving multinational companies engaged in widespread healthcare fraud and abuse, and &lsquo;grand&rsquo; corruption occurring at high levels of government. Once it invades, it is often difficult to detect or diagnose and, most importantly, is hard to treat.Critically, health-related corruption is distinctly dangerous compared to other forms in that it presents a &lsquo;dual-burden&rsquo; of limiting both economic and human development while at the same time endangering patients and population-level health. Its cost can also extend beyond the people and communities it directly impacts.The motivation of different actors to engage in health-related corruption should come as no surprise. The healthcare sector is one of the fastest and largest segments of the global economy, accounting for nearly 10 per cent of the worldwide gross domestic product according to the World Bank.
