In solidarity with their colleagues in public facilities, doctors in private hospitals will withdraw their services every Thursday until the Government honours the striking medics&#39; demands.With the support from the private doctors, the stalemate between striking medics and the Government has now taken a different turn. And the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union leaders stuck to their guns, saying they will not be moved by tomorrow&#39;s ruling on the strike by the Labour Relations Court unless it is made in their favour.The union&#39;s secretary general, Ouma Oluga, was adamant that if the ruling does not address their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), they would not return to work.&quot;Unless the CBA is implemented, we are not going back to work and as it stands now, the Government has continued to show that it does not care about its citizens,&quot; Dr Oluga said in response to statements attributed to Government Spokesperson Eric Kiraithe that the country has shown it can do without doctors. ALSO READ: Are we getting comfortable with the health crisis in Kenya? &quot;This shows just how insensitive the State is and this has been its attitude for the past three years,&quot; he said.The doctors have maintained that they will not relent until their needs are met. Oluga challenged the Government to give figures on how many patients had died due to the ongoing strike. The doctors said the deaths are more than what the Government is reporting.
