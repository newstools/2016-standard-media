Police used teargas canisters to disperse a group of protesters dubbed #TakeBackKenya Monday morning along Moi Avenue, Nairobi and arrested three people. The protest was meant to denounce corruption, bad governance and other vices in the country and call on Kenyans to be firm when police arrived and dispersed it. A group of protesters had gathered near Tom Mboya statue when anti-riot police arrived and lobbed teargas canisters at them before arresting three of them. The protesters dispersed and rushed to Jevanjee Gardens where they said they will proceed with another march. Take Back Kenya is a movement geared towards standing up against the daily plundering of public funds by government officials through corruption.
