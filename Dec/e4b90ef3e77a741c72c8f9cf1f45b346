The High Court has ordered the Government to pay a private company Sh1.5 billion for the Embakasi military land.Justice George Odunga directed the Government&ndash; through the Ministry of Defence&ndash;to pay Torino Enterprises Ltd the money. The court said the State cannot hide under budgetary allocation by Parliament to delay payments.The judge found the reasons given by the State for not paying the money for the past five years does not hold water as the ministry has not asked for the amount to be included in the budget over the period.&quot;In my view, the reasons advanced by the respondents for the failure to satisfy the decree are flimsy excuses meant to deny the applicant the fruits of the judgement and I have no reason to decline the grant orders sought herein,&quot; the judge found.
