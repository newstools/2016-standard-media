Government has cut the irrigation budget by Sh6.8 billion and postponed irrigation of one project and scaled down another.In revised targets for 2016-17, National Treasury slashed the supplementary estimates for the State department of irrigation from Sh19.04 billion to Sh12.24 billion due to financial constraints.&quot;The reduction is on account of a decrease of Sh6.8 billion in capital expenditure due to changes in level of donor commitment,&quot; the Government said in the document containing new targets. Programmes affected by the adjustments in the expenditure include irrigation, land reclamation, water storage and flood control.The Government had planned to irrigate phase II of Lower Nyanza Irrigation Project that would have covered 450 acres. This has been put off for now.In addition, work on the Mwea irrigation project has been scaled down. Some 1,500 acres will be sacrificed. In the current financial year, the new estimates show that just 1,000 acres will be done.The changes will see expenditure drop by Sh16.6 million to Sh933 billion.Capital expenditure, under which the two projects fall, will reduce by over a third to Sh11.32 billion. Initially, the gross estimate was Sh18.1 billion. The Galana-Kulalu irrigation development project will go on as planned. The plan to develop a 10,000 acres in the pilot phase has been retained in the revised estimates.Bura irrigation scheme will see a 25km canal constructed and 100 acres put under irrigation as earlier planned.The State Department will also go on with a programme to irrigate 200 acres of small-holder farms.Under the Jubilee Manifesto, the Government had committed to irrigating one million acres. This was to be through implementation of projects such as Galana-Kulalu, national expanded programme and smallholder irrigation development.
