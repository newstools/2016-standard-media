A local Jubilee faction that lost the disputed branch polls held this month has refused to recognise those who were declared winners.A group allied to Mombasa businessmen Suleiman Shahbal and which won the polls announced on Saturday that it was ready to reconcile with the faction that was out-voted. But the faction allied to former assistant minister Anania Mwaboza came out strongly yesterday to deny reports that it had resolved to work with Mr Shahbal and demanded fresh elections instead.&quot;We have been steadfast in Jubilee and will remain so to ensure that my president and his deputy William Ruto are re-elected&quot; said Janet Mirobi, a staunch JP supporter.Shahbal said both factions belonged to Jubilee and should concentrate on campaigning for President Uhuru Kenyatta.

We cannot enter the battle field as a divided army,&quot; said Mombasa Woman Representative hopeful Margaret &#39;Ambasa&#39; Kisiengo on Saturday.Jomvu parliamentary aspirant Liban Hirsi defended the Shahbal team led by Matana Chengo, noting that it had the full backing of genuine Jubilee members.JUBILEE SHIP&quot;We are aware that our colleagues who chose to boycott the exercise were &#39;sponsored&#39; by Opposition leaders and their actions were meant purely to wreck the Jubilee ship and prevent it from docking in Mombasa,&quot; Mr Hirsi said. &quot;They will not achieve much as the ship has already docked.&quot;For the better part of last week, sharp rivalries played out in the open as the two factions went out for each other with claims that the interim office bearers were not duly elected into office.Officials elected during the polls presided over by former TNA chairman Onyango Oloo included Matano Chengo (chairman) and Teresia Mwenda as his deputy.Ali Mwatsahu, who lost the interim branch chairman&#39;s post to Mr Chengo, maintained that no elections were held and insisted on fresh polls.
