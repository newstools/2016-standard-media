Pressure is mounting on Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa to vie for the Trans Nzoia governor&rsquo;s seat.On the eve of Christmas, hundreds of Trans Nzoia residents camped at his Milimani home in Kitale and asked Mr Wamalwa not to run for the city governorship and instead vie in his Trans Nzoia backyard. The residents, including elders from different communities who arrived at the home as early as 7.00 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, braved the scorching sun and stayed at the Cabinet Secretary&rsquo;s home until his arrival late in the evening.&ldquo;We want you to abandon your plan to vie for the Nairobi gubernatorial seat and instead come home and make things right for us. You have our endorsement and full blessings because we believe in your ability to lead,&rdquo; said Kapomboi Ward MCA Edward Kitur.Speaker after speaker pleaded with Wamalwa to shelve his ambitions for Nairobi politics and return home.

Do not let us down at the time that we need you,&rdquo; said John Gatua, a Agikuyu Community elder in the County.MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTWamalwa publicly stated he would make a big announcement on February 5, 2017 when he quits the Cabinet.&ldquo;I have heard the pleas of my people and out of respect I will go and thank President Uhuru Kenyatta. I am grateful for the flag he allowed me to fly and tell him that my people need me to fly another flag,&rdquo; he said to the crowd at his home.When The Standard contacted him on the happenings, Wamalwa&nbsp; reiterated that the people had called on him to vie for the governorship and he cannot overlook their demands but will make a major announcement in 2017 when he quits.&ldquo;I am only under pressure from the people and not other quarters and I will make that open in February, all in all I will wear the same uniform that President Uhuru will wear during the next elections irrespective of what I will go for,&rdquo; he said.However, a close aide who sought anonymity claimed the CS was angling for a bigger political role and that the push by a section of top Jubilee leaders from Central Kenya to have him vie for the Nairobi governorship was a wider scheme to market him nationally. ALSO READ: Legislators have let Kenyans down&ldquo;The decision by Central region leaders to back Eugene for the Nairobi seat is a clear indicator the CS is being engaged in the presidential succession politics. Get it from me that Eugene will play a great role in the Uhuru succession,&rdquo; the aide told The Standard.Eugene said it does not matter where he will vie.&ldquo;Be it in Nairobi or Trans-Nzoia, I&rsquo;m up to the task,&rdquo; he said.
