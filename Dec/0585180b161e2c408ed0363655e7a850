The Standard Group has called on the Ugandan government to&nbsp;drop&nbsp;charges&nbsp;levelled against KTN journalist Joy Doreen Biira. Describing the&nbsp;charges&nbsp;as fake,&nbsp;Standard Group Chief Executive Officer Sam Shollei called on all journalists in the country to collect signatures in solidarity and lodge a petition with the Ugandan government to have the&nbsp;charges&nbsp;withdrawn and the case terminated. Ms Biira is facing&nbsp;charges&nbsp;of abetting terrorism following her updates on social media on the mass killings in Kasese, Uganda. Following the posts, Biira was arrested and had to spend her Sunday night in custody. She had been in the country to attend her traditional wedding ceremony. Mr Shollei criticised the treatment accorded to Biira by the Ugandan government. He was speaking yesterday during Multi Choice award ceremony for this year&rsquo;s CNN Journalist of the Year winners.
