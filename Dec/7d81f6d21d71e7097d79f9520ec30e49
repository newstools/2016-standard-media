KERICHO: Energy Cabinet Secretary (CS) Charles Keter has said that the government is assessing the Nairobi-Londiani-Muhuroni &ndash;Kisumu pipeline for a place for the construction of a new line.Speaking at Kaminjewet location in Bureti constituency during the handing over a Sh9M resource centre constructed by the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), Keter said the new pipeline will supply petroleum products to Migori County among other adjacent areas. &quot;The new pipeline will make it easier for our customers to access refined petroleum products. The government will also put a pump station in Kericho County because currently the main tanks are in Kisumu and Nakuru and it&#39;s far for our south rift customers,&quot; he said.The Energy CS who was accompanied by KPC managing director Joe Sang, former National Housing Corporation Chairman Sammy Chepkwony and Kericho County Speaker Japheth Mutai, also said that the government will spend Sh1B in Kericho for the Last Mile electricity connection programme.&quot;When Jubilee came to power in 2013 only 32 per cent of Kericho residents had been connected to the national grid but by June next year, we would have supply the electricity to over 80 per cent of them. I want to say it is not here alone but the entire country,&quot; said Keter.
