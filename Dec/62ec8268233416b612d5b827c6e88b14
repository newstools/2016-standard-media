A former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent charged with illegal possession of guns claimed his surety was withdrawn after his wife deserted him. Richard Clyde Rollier told a court in Mombasa that his wife&#39;s cousin, who had provided the surety, withdrew it after the desertion. Mr Rollier and his Kenyan wife, Mercy Shirley Mwendwa, were arrested on March 2016 and charged with five counts of being in possession of two stun guns without lawful authority. The two denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Susan Shitubi and were released on a bond of Sh500,000 with a similar surety. The State later withdrew the charges against Ms Mwendwa for lack of evidence. Last week, Rollier was arrested by Anti-Terror Police Unit officers for jumping bail and detained for seven days. READ: Kibor's wife: I don't see why he is divorcing me Thursday, he denied jumping bail and said he had been in Nairobi attending a conference. He produced travel tickets and press articles of him addressing the conference. He complained that his wife&#39;s cousin, Henry Mugambi Mugina, had withdrawn the surety altogether without contacting him. Mr Mugambi confirmed he was related to Mwendwa and was withdrawing the surety. &quot;The reason I stood as surety in the first place was because the accused was married to a person related to me and now they are no longer married,&quot; said Mugambi. Rollier then got a real estate contractor as a new guarantor.
