Leaders from Laikipia have demanded eviction of armed herders who have invaded private lands with thousands of livestock. Led by Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri and National Cohesion and Integration Commission Chairman Francis ole Kaparo, the leaders have asked the government to order resumption of disarmament and eviction exercise to evict herders. Laikipia East MP Anthony Mutahi said the skirmishes will only be resolved if the illegal herders, especially from neighbouring Samburu County who have been accused of attacking residents and invading with thousands of livestock are flushed out. &quot;We do not need either mediation or peace caravans. What will restore peace is total eviction of the herders,&quot; he said. Speaking during a crisis meeting held at Nanyuki Social Hall, the leaders resolved that appointing Agriculture PS Richard Lesiyampe as mediator in issues affecting the area meant there was an internal problem. Governor Joshua Irungu, county commissioner Onesmus Musyoki, speaker Patrick Mariru attended. ALSO READ: Why you should never dump old car batteries on your farm
