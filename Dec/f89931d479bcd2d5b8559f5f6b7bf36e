And in the Democratic Republic of Congo, politicians have agreed in principle to a deal under which President Joseph Kabila leaves office by the end of next year.African leaders need to wake up to the fact that their voice is not necessarily the people&rsquo;s aspiration and that the masses have realised that they are indeed entitled to a better future and alternative leadership.Kabila, the President of the DRC since 2001, is among a breed of African big men gradually driving themselves into extinction by illegally holding on to power for too long, antagonising entire populations.
