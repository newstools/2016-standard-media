&nbsp; Webuye-based Pan Paper Mills resumed operations yesterday cutting the 10-year wait to resuscitate the once economic pillar in western Kenya. At noon yesterday, the Government announced that the boiler for paper manufacturing was powered on to produce first batch of papers. This offers a glimpse of hope to locals in a year that has seen many companies announce jobs cuts. They will be hoping that it stays afloat unlike before when attempts to revive it have not been sustainable. In April this year, the receivers of Pan Paper reached an agreement to sell it to a local investor, paving way for the revival of the company. The investor plans to inject up to Sh6 billion spread over a five-year period to rehabilitate the machines. In a press statement from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, CS Adan Mohamed said the investor is putting in place various measures to prepare the factory ahead of its reopening by President Kenyatta on December 15.
