Chief Justice David Maraga has received the support of an activist who wants to join a case challenging his new rules on corruption cases.Charles Omanga filed an application to be enjoined in the suit, arguing that the application filed by lawyer Peter Wanyama challenging the practice guidelines for the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Court was a ploy by cartels to derail the CJ&#39;s fight against corruption. &quot;I want to be enjoined in the case to demonstrate that the CJ&#39;s directives were timely and necessary to curb the rising corruption and prove that those opposing it are cartels who want to continue enjoying protection,&quot; said Mr Omanga.Justice George Odunga directed that the application be heard tomorrow. Mr Wanyama accused the CJ of doing things unilaterally without consulting key stakeholders when he published the practice guidelines for the anti-corruption court.
