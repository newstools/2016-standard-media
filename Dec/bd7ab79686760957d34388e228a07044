Meru politicians have been warned against inciting residents to violence over the boundary dispute between Tharaka Nithi and Isiolo counties. National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) chairman Francis ole Kaparo yesterday said all boundary disputes should be put on hold until after the 2017 elections, as a precautionary step against politicians out to use the issue for political expediency. &ldquo;The boundary disputes pitting Tharaka Nithi and Meru, Isiolo and parts of Tharaka against Imenti should not be allowed to escalate in this electioneering period. Elders must play their role of ensuring peace among the communities involved is maintained,&rdquo; said Mr Kaparo. He said his commission was aware of politicians who were fomenting hatred in the region for political gain ahead of the 2017 General Election. Mr Kaparo, who was speaking at the Njuri Ncheke Shrine at Nchiru, said Meru and Tharaka Nithi governors as well as other leaders, have no right to dictate where the boundary lies and appealed to residents to ignore their pronouncements.

There is no need to arm yourself with spears or guns against one another,&rdquo; said Mr Kaparo. He was flanked by the NCIC Commissioner Gitile Naituli and Njuri Ncheke leaders led by Josphat Murangiri and Linus Kathera. Mr Naituli urged the Njuri Ncheke to ensure no politician uses border disputes as a stepping stone to power.
