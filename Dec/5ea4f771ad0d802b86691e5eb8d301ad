Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on regional tax collaboration.The MOU, signed under African Tax Administration Forum and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, enables Kenya to embrace new tax partnerships that will help in dealing with tax evasion.&nbsp;KRA&rsquo;s Commissioner for Domestic Taxes Benson Korongo said, &ldquo;For tax administration to be effective, we need to continuously invest in developing data on companies within our borders and share the information with other jurisdictions across the continent.&rdquo; He further stated that embracing tax partnerships would help African countries benchmark against global best practices to make their systems more efficient. Also speaking was James Karanja, head of the Tax Inspectors Without Borders, the body charged with addressing widespread tax avoidance by multinational enterprises in developing countries. He said, &ldquo;Developing countries face serious challenges in raising domestic resources to fund basic Government services, and tax avoidance by multinational enterprises is a complicating factor.&rdquo;
