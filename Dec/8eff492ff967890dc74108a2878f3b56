KISUMU, KENYA: Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has dismissed as irresponsible reporting article appearing in media outlets terming him too busy with ODM politics at the expense of County projects.He said that he is a politician but that has not affected his service to the county including attending launches of important projects. He blamed the journalist for blowing out of proportion his remarks made on on light note during the launch of e-trade licensing system.&ldquo;On a light note, I explained to our development partners that as&nbsp; Governor, I am also a politician who must actively participate in political activities as I responded to a concern on why I had not honoured an invitation to Estonia and instead sent other government officers to follow up on our earlier partnership agreements,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My attention has however been drawn to a story in a section of the media , totally misrepresenting the facts - either by design or default, to malign my image and that of my party ODM as being anti- development.&rdquo; &ldquo;As an ODM governor, it is the manifesto of the party that I implement in Kisumu. I participate in the affairs of the party because it is my responsibility as a life member to do so. As I urge the party members and my supporters to ignore such irresponsible reporting, I wish&nbsp; to assure you of my firm commitment and support to the party to ensure our leader Rt Hon Raila Odinga captures Presidency in 2017,&rdquo; he added.On Wednesday the county launched e-trade licensing system which seeks to boost revenue collection and make our business systems more transparent,&nbsp;accountable and effective.&nbsp; This initiative is a collaboration between the county government of Kisumu and the World Bank Group. Present at the launch were the business community and some of our development partners.
