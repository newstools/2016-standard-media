The impasse between the two clans has made life difficult, the water in furrows and pipes to my farm and my neighbours&#39; have been delinked by the other clan there and we depend on water supply from the county&#39;s water boozer which needs to be escorted by police too,&quot; explained Kimaiyo.According to the locals, the situation is getting worse despite more security officers being deployed to the area.
