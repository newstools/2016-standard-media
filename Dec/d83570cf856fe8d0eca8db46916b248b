Nairobi, Kenya: CORD co-principals Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka will meet today to hold talks on super alliance. The formation of a united bloc by the Opposition gained momentum on Tuesday after Raila Odinga and Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi said the outfit would be launched in February next year. Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s allies confirmed that there are background talks going on to bring all opposition leaders together ahead of the August 8, 2017 General Election. Mr Wetang&rsquo;ula will however not attend the meeting between the two CORD luminaries as he is in Australia.
