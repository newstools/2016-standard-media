&nbsp;Kenyans hiding their wealth in commercial banks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will be exposed by January 1. A decision has been made to lift the veil of secrecy on undeclared wealth in the UAE, which includes the emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, as part of a global push to fight tax evasion.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is leading the push to end financial secrecy, which has promoted corruption while helping businesses dodge paying taxes.Already, Kenya has extended an incentive to individuals who have stashed money abroad to return it home tax free, with no questions asked about the source.

All the firms in the structure were owned by the same person, with the Dubai subsidiary making the highest profit.Many taxes are non-existent in the UAE, compared to about 30 per cent payable on incomes among individuals and companies in Kenya, prompting the rich to falsely book most of their earnings as having been generated in the emirates.Repatriation of the profits is, however, a complex affair, meaning that Kenyans with accumulated wealth in offshore jurisdictions, either from business or corruption, could take advantage of the amnesty before facing impending OECD-driven exposure.The Government is well aware of the billions of shillings stashed in offshore jurisdictions, which informed the policy step to grant amnesty. Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich directed the Kenya Revenue Authority to allow Kenyans who have wealth abroad to bring it home without being taxed.
