Top performers &quot;The remaining two top performers per sub-county will be placed according to candidature strength because there are areas with very low candidature,&quot; reads the revised 2015 Form One selection criterion. This means that the rest of the candidates in each sub-county will be selected based on candidature strength between public and private schools. The formula used during 2015 Form One selection, further states how candidates will be placed to extra-county, county and sub county schools.
