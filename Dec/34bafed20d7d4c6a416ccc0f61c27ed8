President Uhuru Kenyatta today called on the European Union to provide more support to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).President Kenyatta said the continued presence of the threat of Al Shabaab endangers global and regional stability and that was why it is important for the world to support AMISOM. He urged the EU to increase its support to the AMISOM forces fighting the terror group that threatens to undermine governance and economic opportunity.&ldquo;More can be achieved if the African Union Mission to Somalia becomes even more effective.&nbsp; The region&rsquo;s and the world&rsquo;s fight against Al Shabaab in Somalia is one of the frontlines between stability and chaotic insecurity,&rdquo; said the President.President Kenyatta made the statement when he officially opened the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly at the Kenyatta International Convention Center.&ldquo;I urge the European Parliamentarians present to push for the change we all want to see, by insisting on bolder investment in security in the Horn of Africa and into AMISOM,&rdquo; said the President.He said there is much that ACP countries and Europe can learn from Kenya and contribute to the work to ensure young people are not exploited by the cynical actors who utilize conflict and violence for their own political and economic ends.The President said Kenya has pioneered an all-of-government strategy to prevent extremism, which aims at reducing radicalization, providing rehabilitation, and disengagement from terrorist groups.He said the Government has prioritised policies and investments to ensure that demographic growth turns into an opportunity and not a threat.&ldquo;Our core motivation in making all of these investments, and keeping our foot to the pedal, is to ensure that there will be decent jobs for every Kenyan who wants to work,&rdquo; said the President.The Head of State said Kenya is convinced that it is through industrialization that developing countries can create and sustain sufficient jobs for the youth.&nbsp;In his speech, the President urged the ACP-EU legislators attending the conference to ensure that global trade rules favour developing countries.&ldquo;It is increased investment in the developing countries that will create the jobs for our young populations, the prosperity for our countries, and generate the revenues our governments need to give a helping hand to the most vulnerable,&rdquo; said the President.He said global peace will be fostered when the most vulnerable are empowered.He said today&rsquo;s global conditions are unfavourable to the people of the developing world including Africa.&ldquo;As long as the present economic and geopolitical conditions apply, we will continue to see Africans drowning in the Mediterranean as they desperately seek opportunity. This does not have to be the case,&rdquo; said the President.Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi said economic growth in Africa and large parts of ACP is more robust than the global average.He said Africa will continue being the source of global economic growth because of its resilient strong growth, a youthful population coupled with highest yields on investment.&ldquo;In the developed World, growth is dragging and indications are that, it will remain modest, particularly as population growth remains limited. Yet most capital and technology is concentrated here,&rdquo; he saidOther speakers were Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly Netty Baldeh and Louis Michel&nbsp;
