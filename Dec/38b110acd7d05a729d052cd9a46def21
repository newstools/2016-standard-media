At the height of a teachers&rsquo; strike that crippled learning in all schools for over a month, opinion poll firm Ipsos reported Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s approval ratings at 75 per cent.Major disruptions followed the industrial action by teachers, forcing the State to order early closure of all schools on September 19 last year. The President fared two times better than his main rival Raila Odinga, in increasingly questionable poll findings that are wittily released whenever the Government is under immense pressure.It came as no surprise then when Ipsos boss Tom Wolf released new figures on Wednesday, showing that half of Kenyans would vote to re-elect Uhuru were polls to be called today.&ldquo;Do not underrate the power of incumbency because it is a very powerful tool,&rdquo; Mr Wolf said in justifying his firm&rsquo;s findings, coming in the fourth week of a nationwide doctors&rsquo; strike.

The survey placed Kalonzo a distant third with a paltry 2 per cent of national support.The latest favourable rating for Uhuru comes even as the country faces a health crisis after medics downed their tools to press for better pay and working conditions.

Deputy President William Ruto and Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto had fallen out, prompting major concern as the South Rift region is viewed as being critical in the re-election bid of Jubilee Party and Uhuru Kenyatta.The duel between the Rutos has only got worse since, prompting other leaders from the Kalenjin community to push for reconciliation, which has not come through yet.Around the same time in May, pressure was piling over the Government&rsquo;s handling of corruption, following the suspension of several senior officials including five Cabinet secretaries.Uhuru even accused the media of spreading propaganda against his Government, relating to &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo; corruption scandals that were however later confirmed as true.Ipsos surveys have drawn strong criticism from ordinary folk, with many expressing anger against the findings and timings.One Twitter post said: &ldquo;Oh, another perfectly timed @IpsosKe opinion poll released. That tells you there is fire under Muthamaki&rsquo;s seat&rdquo;.
