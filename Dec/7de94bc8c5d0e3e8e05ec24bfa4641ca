A 60-year-old man was Thursday sentenced to life imprisonment for sodomising three minors aged between eight and nine years. Mombasa chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti found Raphael Medadi guilty of all the three counts of sodomy after prosecution proved their case. The suspect&#39;s younger son, who had seen his father waylaying and leading the minors to his house, also told the court that his father had told him to play outside whenever he had the boys in the house. The court heard the minors had complained of stomachache after they had been defiled by the suspect, who did not deny knowing the minors. &quot;After analysing the prosecution evidence, I am satisfied that it is safe to convict the suspect after the minors placed the accused at the scene of crime and identified him. I suspect he had laced their food and sodomised them after they passed out. He is guilty as charged, hence convicted of the offence. You are sentenced to life, you have 14 days to appeal against the judgement,&quot; said the magistrate. The suspect, however, pleaded with the court to be lenient on him since he was an orphan and was the only bread winner for a family of four.
