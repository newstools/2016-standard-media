&nbsp; A saloon car goes up in flames following the fire tragedy that officials say was caused by a canter that was ferrying gas cylinders and glue. (Photo: Courtesy) In yet another tragic occurrence, Kenyans have a lot of questions over the road accident at Karai, Naivasha where over 33 people have lost their lives. Most of the victims died on the spot, some burnt beyond recognition, after the Ugandan registered tanker carrying an allegedly illegal substance burst into flames on impact. On social media platform Twitter, some wondered whether there was any word from the president following the unfortunate incident. @KinyanBoy: Has the President or any relevant state organ issued statement on the Naivasha tragedy? It&#39;s hours into the accident. But who is to blame for the tragedy? Did someone sleep on their their job? According to @stephenwambua_ : Negligence and lack of duty of care is what is leading to such&nbsp;tragic deaths as it has occurred in Naivasha .God help Kenya come to itself. @WesleyDoe_: Whoever erected illegal bumps after Kinungi T/center. Must be so Evil, 1. That&rsquo;s a slop towards Naivasha 2. There are no signs on the bumps There was definitely blame game over who should be held accountable for the disaster. @Owino_: This Naivasha tragedy therefore to me means both transport and security ministry heads, must be brought to book. @erwoti: Theme by KOT from Naivasha Tragedy is GOD, GOD &amp; GOD! When as a country do we take ownership or hold GoK accountable? #Naivashatragedy Coming at a time when health workers are on strike, it is expected that it would be a painful experience for the casualties of the Saturday night incident. &rlm;@_Marsha_: Alafu (Then) anyone surviving will be rushed to that government Naivasha hospital, only to find no doctors. Is corruption playing part in the occurrence?&nbsp;Some twitter users sought to know why a tanker was allowed to use a route other than the one designated for heavy trucks.&nbsp; @Davylubisia: Normaly, a fuel tanker is supposed to use Mai Mahiu-Naivasha route but someone allowed it to use the Kijabe- Naivasha route, corruption can also kill. @jeffichai: Now innocent people have perished in Naivasha because cops pocketed 500 or 1000! How did the tanker pass 3 roadblocks? @RickyElroy: There&#39;s usually at least 4 police blocks between the Mai Mahiu exit and the scene of the Naivasha accident? Did police not notice tanker? @DesmondOguda: Just when we thought our roads were safe this holiday season, Naivasha happens! Such sad news. Another twitter user @AnneWaiguru_ posted: Naivasha, I find it ironical that KOT doesn&#39;t call 4 the resignation of CS for transport or traffic commandants who aid this form corruption. National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) Director General&nbsp;Francis Meja , however, said that the vehicle that caused the fire is not a tanker but a canter which was carrying gas cylinders and inflammable glue.
