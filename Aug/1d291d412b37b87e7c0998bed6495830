Early this year, the rivalry between traditional taxi operators and those working for taxi-hailing service Uber came to a head. Their competition turned ugly, with drivers getting assaulted and vehicles being destroyed.Information technology graduate Elkana Ajowi believes he has found a way to address the main complaint from traditional taxi drivers that the taxi-hailing pricing model was taking away their business. He has created a software that he says, if adopted by regulators, could level the field. The entrepreneur&rsquo;s web-based system would allow the Government to monitor Uber drivers&rsquo; financial transactions to establish the kind of fiscal controls the State can enforce in a bid to level the competition.On a broader scale, the system, Sinepay Electronic Commerce Monitor (ECM), could enable Government agencies like the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) monitor all web-based activities that involve the transfer of money from one party to another.&ldquo;A lot of money is exchanged over the Internet in terms of electronic commerce, but the Government has not been able to adequately earn revenue from these transactions, which run into millions of shillings,&rdquo; Mr Ajowi said.For the system to work, both the control agency, say KRA, and the online service provider must have Sinepay certificates, which are renewed at Sh15,000 ($150) a year.Whenever a transaction is done, say a customer buys an item from an e-Shop, the details of it are captured by the system on three levels &mdash; the seller, the Government agency and Sinepay servers.The Kisumu Polytechnic graduate says the system is foolproof in tracking transactions since they are simultaneously transmitted to their servers and the Government agency in real time.At the end of the year, the Government agency is able to establish what it is owed in taxes. Ajowi said he is currently lobbying public sector officials to adopt the system.
