A&nbsp;prison, as commonly known, is a correctional facility and detention centre where inmates are confined and denied many privileges under state authority.But Narok GK&nbsp;Prison&nbsp;on the outskirts of Narok town turns inmates into agri-business savvy people, majoring in horticulture and agro-forestry to keep them away&nbsp;from&nbsp;idleness that led to them committing crimes. It&rsquo;s 9am when Smart Harvest visits and the inmates armed with&nbsp;farm&nbsp;tools are headed to the&nbsp;prison&nbsp;farm. They provide the much-needed labour for fruits and vegetable&nbsp;farming.To&nbsp;prison&nbsp;officers, the&nbsp;prisoners&nbsp;are made to work on the&nbsp;farm&nbsp;as a punishment, but the inmates say they have acquired important skills and this penalty has changed their ways of life.Established 12 years ago to supplement government income, the six-acre&nbsp;farm&nbsp;has fruit trees such as avocado, oranges, mangoes, bananas and paw paws. It also has tree nurseries, apiary and livestock such as dairy cows and goats.The&nbsp;prisoners&nbsp;say when they complete their jail terms, which do not exceed three years as per the&nbsp;prison&rsquo;s&nbsp;jurisdiction, they will go invest in agriculture to beat idleness.At the&nbsp;farm, the inmates get to learn about&nbsp;grafting&nbsp;fruits such as avocado and mangoes to get superior and more productive varieties, as well as maintenance of the fruit trees to maturity.David Lagat, 23, who is serving an eight-month sentence for being in possession of narcotic drugs, says he wished he had learnt alternative sources of getting income such as agriculture, which he is now passionate about.&ldquo;When I came here months ago, I had no idea of anything to do with&nbsp;farming. I had never imagined horticulture is this lucrative. I have seen fruits being maintained, harvested and sold and there is a lot of money in this,&rdquo; he tells Smart Harvest.The father of two who hails&nbsp;from&nbsp;Eldoret says after serving his jail term, he is planning to establish a vegetable garden and a tree nursery in his one-acre land back home to fend for his family.Another&nbsp;prisoner, Wesley Mutai, 25, serving six months for illegal logging, says he will never engage in the vice again and will now be a pro-environment ambassador by venturing into agro-forestry.Officer in-charge of the&nbsp;farm&nbsp;Joseph Rotich says the&nbsp;farming&nbsp;was aimed at boosting the food security of the&nbsp;prison&nbsp;officers and inmates and the surplus was sold to raise revenue for the government.&ldquo;This&nbsp;farm&nbsp;was started in 2004 and we are now doing very well. We produce milk, fruits such as bananas, pawpaws, oranges and mangoes, which fetch us about Sh30,000 a month&nbsp;fromthe surplus,&rdquo; says Rotich.He affirms that the inmates who have passed through the&nbsp;farm&nbsp;for the last decade have changed&nbsp;from&nbsp;their criminal ways and learnt to be self-dependent by engaging in agriculture.&ldquo;In our six acres, we teach them how to make tree nurseries, how to craft fruits and basic skills on vegetable gardens.&nbsp;From&nbsp;this&nbsp;farm, we have followed up on success stories and most of them are doing well out there,&rdquo; says Rotich.As part of correctional efforts, he says, the&nbsp;farming&nbsp;activities provide a wealth of experience to the inmates undergoing character rehabilitation as they learn to do things on their own and not rush for fast cash that always puts them at logger-heads with the law.Farm&nbsp;manager Pauline Mugambi says despite the&nbsp;farm&nbsp;thriving, there were challenges such as livestock diseases as well as difficulty in getting feeds during dry seasons.Officer in charge of the&nbsp;prison&nbsp;Alfred Musila says the facility is among the best in agriculture in the country.&ldquo;We have seen successes through this&nbsp;farm. After finishing their jail terms, most of our inmates have embraced&nbsp;farming&nbsp;and are now sustaining their families and have been accepted back to the society,&rdquo; he says.
