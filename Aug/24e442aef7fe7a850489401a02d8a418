For John Wainaina Karamba, August 1, 2012 will forever remain etched in his mind.This is the day that the lorry driver&rsquo;s life took an expected turn after he was involved in a road crash. The accident left the 48-year-old man from Icaciri village in Gatundu South with serious spinal cord injuries which saw him become paralysed and unable to walk.Mr Karamba, who was the only bread winner for the family, embarked on a journey to seek medical attention, with high hopes that he would be back on his feet and even resume his job.But four years later, Karamba is still unable to walk. In fact, mobility has been his greatest challenge.&ldquo;I have spent more than Sh1 million on the medication which has been raised through numerous harambees.Despite the medication, I have not been able to stand on my feet. My only hope is that I will one day get healed and be able to feed my family,&rdquo; said the father of four.GOOD SAMARITANKaramba, a father of four, has been relying on PCEA Icaciri Church for help to feed his family.But Karamba can now afford a smile after a Good Samaritan heard his cry and gave him wheelchair.Daniel Munyambu, a former councillor in Basildon, UK, gave him a state-of-the-art electric wheelchair worth Sh150,000 which was presented to him and his family at the PCEA Icaciri Church last Sunday.The wheel chair is electric and can travel for 50km before being recharged. In the absence of power, the wheel chair can also use batteries.Mr Munyambu accused President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s government of failing to implement Article 54 of the Constitution that provides for persons with disability and includes access to buildings, education, housing, transport, employment, healthcare and a social safety net.Karamba thanked Munyambu for the donation. &ldquo;I will now be able to move with ease. May God bless Mr Munyambu abundantly for his kind gesture so that he can be able to assist many more,&rdquo; he said.
