Detectives from outside Kitui County have been sent to investigate the brutal murder of a patient inside a hospital ward.The officers from Nairobi, Machakos and Embu will investigate the killing by gunmen of Fredrick Musyimi, 27, at Mwingi Level Four Hospital. &quot;It is true we have taken up the matter but that is all I can say,&quot; said a CID officer based in Machakos.Despite saying they collected 17 empty cartridges at the scene of the chilling murder, local security officers have remained largely mum over the murder. &quot;You should wait until the matter is conclusively investigated and you will be adequately briefed,&quot; said Kitui County Commissioner Boaz Cherotich.Meanwhile, Musyimi&#39;s sister Sharlyne Malia who witnessed his brother being shot dead in his hospital bed has claimed that the men who killed her brother are after her.On Saturday morning, she slithered out of a family meeting at Kathiani village in Kitui West, after claiming that two men came looking for her.&quot;A man claiming to be a CID officer had earlier called me saying there were new developments on my brother&#39;s killing and wanted us to meet. He also claimed two people who were police officers based in Mwingi had been arrested over the killing and wanted me to go and identify the suspects,&quot; Malia, who visited Standard Group offices in Nairobi after escaping home said.IPOA Chairman Macharia Njeru told us that his office would only be able to offer Malia protection today. Police spokesman Charles Owino had referred our inquiries to IPOA.Meanwhile, nurses and clinical officers at the hospital have demanded a full-time armed police guard following last Wednesday&#39;s killing of the patient.The medical workers on Friday night stormed out of wards and boycotted work after two strange men were spotted inside the ward where Musyimi was brutally murdered.According to senior nurse Ken Muriuki, the two men who refused to talk or answer any questions from hospital staff, visited the ward only two days after the heinous murder.&quot;They did not speak to anybody and when questioned who they were, they walked out and sneaked out of the hospital through a nearby thicket,&quot; Muriuki said.The workers then trooped out of the wards, leaving patients unattended to.A call was then made to Kitui County executive in charge of health Ruth Koki who contacted the police.&quot;Armed policemen were deployed in the hospital and we have resumed duty. However it should be clear that we want full-time armed security not a one-off thing. If the police are withdrawn, we will not work,&quot; Muriuki said.On Wednesday night, two strangers stormed a surgical ward where Musyimi was admitted with gunshot wounds and pumped several bullets into his stomach, killing him instantly as his sister watched.Earlier in the day, Musyimi, a hawker in Kitui town, was picked by four men claiming to be police officers who bundled him inside a white car and drove with him to Ukasi along the Mwingi-Garissa Highway where they shot him severally.Musyimi however survived the first gun attack and was rescued by police officers from Ukasi Police Station and taken to Mwingi Level Four Hospital where he was later killed.Mr Musyimi&#39;s family claims he is a victim of extrajudicial killings.&quot;My brother was picked up by police from his house and was first taken to Kitui Police Station. Later he was brutally killed. They must tell us why they killed him,&quot; said Nicholas Mukando.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said Kenyans and the world are watching how investigations into the murder of the man will be done.He termed the murder of the man who had earlier survived another shooting horrible, inhuman and total disregard to the Constitution.&quot;This is clear execution. The country cannot tolerate this kind of impunity. The killing of the patient cannot be allowed in a civilised world,&quot; the former Vice President said.He was speaking in Kyuso Town in Mwingi North Constituency when he presided over a fundraiser in aid of the area&#39;s women groups at the weekend.The CORD co-principal speculated that the man was a police informer or he had some information the killers wanted to conceal.Mutunga Wambua said he had known Musyimi when he was admitted to Kitui County Referral Hospital between March and April this year after he was stabbed in the stomach by unknown people. He did not wait to be discharged, he escaped from hospital.Musyimi&#39;s brother, Mukando Malia, said he last saw him on August 19. &quot;He had a wound in the ear. He told me he had been shot by police after a robbery at Wikilily, about three kilometres from Kitui town. I nursed him,&quot; he said.Majengo assistant chief Halima Abdi said she had no knowledge of Musyimi or the business he was involved in.
