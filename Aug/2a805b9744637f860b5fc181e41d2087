A family wants local police officers alleged to have tortured their kin to death arrested and prosecuted.David Otwane reportedly succumbed to injuries inflicted by officers at Kachibora Police Station last month after he was arrested over alleged involvement in crime. Otwane, who lived at Toboto village in Kweny District, Eastern Uganda, was arrested alongside his brother Daniel Juma in Chepkoyo village while attending their cousin&rsquo;s funeral.According to family members, Otwane had arrived on July 3, 2016, to attend the burial of his cousin Joshua Cheruiyot when officers arrested him at night.&ldquo;It was around 11pm when we heard knocks on the door and people who identified themselves as police officers ordered us to open. Then they attacked us, claiming we are criminals,&rdquo; Juma told The Standard.The officers allegedly used some lessos that were in the house to gag Otwane and Juma to stop them from screaming.After the beating said to have lasted for over 20 minutes, the officers blindfolded the two brothers and bundled them into a vehicle and drove to Kachibora.The officers allegedly took Sh2,000 from Juma and Sh7,000 from Otwane.Juma claimed that the next morning, his brother was grilled for two hours.&ldquo;He was led back to the cells, limping and in pain. He told me the officers had used a metal clamp to squeeze his private parts in order to confess that he is a criminal operating between Kenya and Uganda,&rdquo; he said.NO CHARGESJuma was released two days later with no charges preferred against him but Otwane was detained for two weeks as officers investigated his alleged involvement in crime.Otwane was released from custody only to die four days later at Kitale District Hospital from what doctors said was internal bleeding.&ldquo;We pleaded with the officers to take us to hospital for treatment but they refused,&rdquo; Juma claimedJuma was later taken to Sibanga Health Centre by his cousin Christopher Keter, where he was treated and discharged.Keter, who has been pursuing Otwane&rsquo;s case at the station, blamed the officers for his death and demanded investigations on his alleged torture and illegal detention.Trans Nzoia County Commander Lillian Okembo confirmed Otwane was arrested and released but denied the torture claim.She said Otwane was arrested after a woman complained that he had abducted her daughter and threatened to kill family members.&ldquo;We arrested the man after the woman reported that he abducted and married her underage daughter and planned to harm family members. He was also probed for possessing Kenyan and Ugandan identification cards,&rdquo; said Ms Okembo.Right activists, led by Eric Rono from Catholic Justice and Peace Commission in Kitale, urged Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to investigate the torture claims.
