KISUMU: Komoro village in Nyakach, Kisumu County was Thursday engulfed in grief as friends and relatives of former veteran trade unionist Denis Akumu came to terms with the news of his death.Chuth Ber Akumu Jakogero, as he was commonly known in the village, had his last breath on Thursday morning at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi after a long illness. Memories of his brave but simple life as a trade unionist and a politician ringed in the minds of those who shared podium with him, with most of them describing him as &#39;the only Luo Politician who ever earned trust&#39; from Kenyan First President Jomo Kenyatta.At one point he had to use a lorry as his mode of private transport for his safety at the heart of the 1969 Central Organisation of Trade Union (Cotu) elections.Akumu was COTU (K)&#39;s Secretary General from 1969 to 1975 and a founder Secretary General of the Organisation of African Trade Union Unity, (OATUU) based in Accra, Ghana.Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli described him as an international icon who had immense contribution in the betterment of the welfare of workers.&quot;He was a well versed, polished and trained negotiator whose service as a Trade Union leader to the Kenyan workers and Africa as whole will forever remain in the annuals of our history as a leader who served with zeal and commitment devoid of any neither compromise nor sway,&quot; said Atwoli.According to Akumu&rsquo;s long-time friend and driver Mzee Nyamolo Okal who was born in the same year with him 83 years ago, he was suspicious of threats by his opponents in the Cotu Secretary General election which he had won, but was contested. &quot;Mr Akumu felt his life was in danger, and some friends advised him that the opponents would use any means to assassinate him, so I had to drive him in a lorry to private functions within Nairobi as we felt the lorry could stand any initiated suicidal road accident compared to the small cars he used previously,&quot; said Okal. &quot;Akumu was the remaining Tom Mboya. He was brilliant and conscious in his deeds and the late Jomo Kenyatta once told us that the only Luos he comfortably had physical contacts with were Tom Mboya and Denis Akumu,&quot; said Okal.The late Akumu attended Onjiko Intermediary School in the 1940s before undertaking a medical course which enabled him serve as a public health officer in the Nairobi Municipal Council.He had an ambition of proceeding with his education abroad, and after getting admission to join a university in India, he could not raise enough money for the fees and the dream dwindled before he moved to Mombasa where he joined politics.&quot;He became a councillor in Mombasa, and later worked at the Dock where his vibrancy led to his election as the Secretary to the Dock Workers Union to which he served to higher positions in the Central Organisation of Trade Union,&quot; said Okal.After long service in the trade union within Mombasa and Nairobi, Akumu joined active politics.According to Okal, the late Mzee Jomo Kenyata had tried in vain to convince him to contest a seat in Nairobi, as he felt the young man had spent most of his public life in Nairobi and Mombasa, hence would not make it in his Nyakack backyard.Okal was among the few friends Mr Akumu ferried to State House in Nairobi to show Kenyatta that he had home support and would clinch Nyakach Parliamentary seat, even as Kenyatta was worried that his friend&#39;s failure to clinch the seat would bring shame to him and the presidency.&quot;He had no house at home, and he had to stay in my rented house in Sondu Market during the entire campaign period. I had to leave my family back in the rural home so that we had enough space for Akumu who eventually won the seat and we ensured he built a house,&quot; he said.His political legacy is however still alive as his widow Grace Akumu has remained an icon in Kisumu County leadership and is eying the area Women Representative position in the 2017 election through her newly formed Citizen Convention Party.Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma described Akumu&#39;s death as; &quot;a great setback to the entire labour movement. Akumu also dedicated his entire life for the struggle for democratization of Kenya.&quot;Naki, Guu and Ndori Secondary Schools and Sigoti Health Centre remain as the landmark projects he initiated during his two terms as the area MP.On Thursday friends and relatives thronged the home as clan elders met to deliberate on his burial arrangement, coordinated through his niece Enos Okolo, a lecturer in a Somali-based University and uncle Ooro Odero, as close family members travelled to Nairobi for similar arrangements.
