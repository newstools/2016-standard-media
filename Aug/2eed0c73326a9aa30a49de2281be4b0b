Kenya Airways (KQ) is betting on new technology from global air transport communications provider SITA to manage its route network.The communications provider is set to roll out a solution that will guarantee secure, fast and cost-effective connectivity for services, such as reservations, check-in and boarding. According to KQ CEO Mbuvi Ngunze, the new solution will help the national carrier connect its Nairobi hub to all destinations with ease.&ldquo;As we seek to position KQ for the future, we needed a single communications partner that could take care of all our connectivity requirements no matter where we operate,&rdquo; said Mr Ngunze.Through SITA Connect, the airline will be able to link its employees and sales offices around the world to Kenya Airways&rsquo; central systems and applications across 53 destinations.KQ also hopes to drive new efficiencies in the management of its route network and enhance the experience of the four million passengers it serves each year on average.Already, the shared connectivity platform has been successful in more than 300 airports in over 100 countries. Using SITA&rsquo;s common-use infrastructure eliminates the complexity of dealing with local telecom providers.SITA President for Middle East, India and Africa Hani El-Assaad said the technology would suit KQ&rsquo;s unique requirements in business.&ldquo;Connectivity on demand is the lifeblood of any airline, ensuring the smooth and rapid exchange of information needed to support effective operations no matter where in the world an airline operates, the size of their operation or their business model,&rdquo; he said.
