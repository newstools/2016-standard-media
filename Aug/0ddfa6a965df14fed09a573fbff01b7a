A clan settlement that could see the entire political leadership in Mandera County replaced is gaining momentum in north eastern.Three weeks ago, a 20-member Garre Council of Elders meeting at the border town of Banisa agreed that most leaders in the county should not defend their seats in the 2017 election for the sake of the community&rsquo;s unity in the 20 sub clans. And now, similar forms of so-called negotiated democracy appears to be taking shape in Garissa, Wajir and Marsabit counties, sparking heated debate as leaders take different positions.At a ceremony attended by hundreds of residents and leaders at Bourargy Primary School last Saturday, the Abduwak clan - one of the big clans in Garissa endorsed Ali Korane for gubernatorial seat against Governor Nathif Jama.Garissa County is dominated by the Ogaden Somali community, which has three clans; the Abdulwak, Auliyan and Samawathal.The overriding argument is to maintain inter-clan unity and harmony. The Auliyan clan has two constituencies, Lagdera and Dadaab, while the Abuduwak clan has three; Garissa Township, Fafi and Balambala.Decide on fateAs stated by an elder from Abduwak, the elders will meet to decide on the fate of Balambala MP Abdikhadir Aden, Elyas Bare Shill (Fafi), Abdinoor Mohamed (nominated MP) and MCAs. According to Aden Mohamed, one of the elders from the Abduwak clan, the National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale who comes from the sub-clan will be allowed to defend his seat but Mbalambala MP and his Fafi counterpart could be casualties of the &lsquo;negotiated democracy&rsquo;.&ldquo;In our arrangement that will reached in two weeks, Mbalambala and Fafi will be the two constituencies that would be traded in by the sub-clan so as to retain the governorship position and that of Garissa Town seat,&rdquo; said Mohammed.Mohammed said they will decide if they want to change the current set up of MPs and MCAs but hinted that Duale, given his political seniority in the Jubilee coalition would most likely be let off the hook.Similar endorsement is expected in Wajir, among the Fai, the biggest sub-clan in the county predominantly in Tarbaj and Wajir East constituencies.In Marsabit, there is a similar pact that elders agreed on and endorsed NHIF board chairman Mohammed Ali as their Jubilee preferred candidate was final.According to Saku MP Dido Rasso has said the decision of the elders Ali as their Jubilee preferred candidate was final.Rasso said Ali was endorsed by 60 elders, MPs and Members of the County Assembly from the Borana, Burji, Rendile and part of Gabra community members and would mount a formidable campaign against CORD&rsquo;s current Governor, Yakur Yattani.While Gabra have supposedly settled for the current governor, Ikur Yatani, the Borana to face off with the National Hospital Insurance Fund board chairman.Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow has pledged to abide by the elders wish not to vie. But the decision by Governor Ali Roba to ignore the counsel has sparked debate on whether the new &lsquo;democracy&rsquo; is sustainable and makes &lsquo;sense&rsquo; in modern day Kenya.Wajir West MP Abdikadir Ore Ahmed said the process was fraud and an avenue for a few people to make money purporting to give endorsement for political seats.&ldquo;We want to have competitive elective politics decided by the one-man one-vote,&rdquo; said Ahmed.The Mandera governor has vowed to defy the elders&rsquo; decision and be on the ballot in next year&rsquo;s elections.&ldquo;I am answerable to my people, they will be the ones to judge what I have done and return a verdict if they want me to continue building on what I have started. I respect the elders&rsquo; decision but I will soldier on,&rdquo; Roba told The Standard on Sunday.He said he had offered himself to the people, including risking his life while on duty in the county and therefore it would be unfair to dismiss him.&ldquo;I began my work passionately. Unlike most leaders in the county, I spend more time in Mandera traversing across the six constituencies, and I have literally visited every cluster homestead listening and addressing the plight of our people. These are the people who will decide my fate next year as I seek another term,&rdquo; said Roba.But Kerrow said he was bound by the elders&rsquo; ruling and would not contest in 2017.&ldquo;There is no point in going against the decision by the elders,&rdquo; he said.
