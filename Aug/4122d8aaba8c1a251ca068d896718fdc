NAIROBI, KENYA: Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery has told social media users to be wary of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts in his name purporting to offer scholarships. Nkaissery said the issue is now being investigated by the Cyber Crime Unit and he expected those behind the same to be arrested and prosecuted. &quot;One such pseudo account on Facebook is offering purported scholarships and bursaries to university students and asking for mobilisation fee. The truth of the matter is that there is NO such a program being run by the CS,&quot; a statement from his office said. He urged social media users to be careful when dealing with comments and/or direct messages purported to be from him to avoid falling prey to the cyber criminals. &quot;The Cabinet Secretary&#39;s official and verified accounts are @GenNkaisserry for Twitter while his WhatsApp number is 0719777719. He said any communication emanating from other accounts should be treated with extreme suspicion and immediately reported to the authorities for appropriate action.Such incidents are on the rise with calls on online users to be careful whenever they are endorsing or commenting on any comments posted. &nbsp;
