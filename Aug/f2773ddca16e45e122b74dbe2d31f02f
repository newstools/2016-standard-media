Governor Peter Munya has moved to calm fears that his planned takeover of the Party of National Unity (PNU) will not succeed.The Council of Governors chairman said all was set for the national delegates conference (NDC) in Nairobi next month, where he will be endorsed as the party&rsquo;s new leader.Reports had indicated PNU was one of the parties that had agreed to a merger deal with United Republican Party, The National Alliance, Senator Kiraitu Murungi&rsquo;s Alliance Party of Kenya and others. But Mr Munya insisted that PNU was not among parties that will fold to join the Jubilee Party.&ldquo;There is only one person who has gone to Jubilee Party. Other members of PNU do not want the merger. We are going to go to the NDC to elect the party&rsquo;s leaders,&rdquo; Munya said.PNU Interim Chairman John Kamama had announced PNU had agreed to merge with other parties supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto&rsquo;s dream to bring all affiliate parties under one roof.&ldquo;I assure you PNU is firm. Before it was not being talked about but things have changed now that I am in it,&rdquo; Munya said.
