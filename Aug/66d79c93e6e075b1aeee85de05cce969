A man who thought he was on the verge of becoming a multi-millionaire from black magic is now counting losses.Robert Otieno had been convinced by people purporting to be witchdoctors to fetch Sh6 million, which they promised to multiply using a refrigerator to make him super rich. Impressed by the prospects, Mr Otieno went ahead to sell his parcel of land at Kanyakwar for Sh6 million.He used part of the money to buy the refrigerator, which he transported to the purported&nbsp; witchdoctors&rsquo; house last Wednesday for the fortunes-changing miracle.As part of the ritual, Otieno had been instructed by the witchdoctors led by their kingpin, known as&nbsp;&ldquo;Ndumba wa Ndumba&rdquo;, not to open the fridge for 36 days.The bundles of money were to be placed in the fridge while the conmen prayed to multiply the cash.But fortunately for Otieno, police&nbsp;officers acting on a tip-off arrived just as the so-called witchdoctors were doing their &ldquo;abracadabras&rdquo;.The six conmen, including foreigners, escaped from the compound the moment they heard police officers coming in.The officers found several bundles of cash that the &lsquo;witchdoctors&rsquo; were yet to steal from the man.Unfortunately, the criminals had already pocketed Sh1 million.&ldquo;I thought the prayers by the doctors (conmen) were going to transform my life and help me get rid of the challenges that I always face in my daily life,&rdquo; said Otieno later.He said he fell for the witchdoctors&rsquo; lies after hearing a local radio station advertising the services that they were offering.Among the items that police recovered from the house included witchcraft paraphernalia, foreign currency notes, people&rsquo;s photographs and a book with a list of clients.Nyanza Regional Administration Commandant Joseph Chepkeitany said police are pursuing the suspects and cautioned residents against being lured into such deals.Incredibly, Otieno lost Sh1.2 million three months ago in a similar scam.
