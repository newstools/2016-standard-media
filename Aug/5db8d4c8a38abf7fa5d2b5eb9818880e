MERU: An MP and several MCAs have backed Governor Peter Munya to retain his seat in next year&rsquo;s general election.Tigania West MP David Kariithi and MCAs Kithinji Ethaiba (Nkomo), Nturibi Etirikia (Akithi) and Zaberio Kianji (Kianjai) said all the 45 wards had been economically uplifted since Munya took over as governor.They said he should be given another term to continue with his development agenda. The three MCAs said the Council of Governors Chairman was Meru&rsquo;s best political prospect as he intends to run for president in 2022. Speaking at Lubunu in Kianjai where Munya commissioned a borehole, Mr Kariithi said he was fully behind Munya.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will work and support you to hold onto your seat. All of us should support our governor, for him to serve for 10 years,&rdquo; Mr Kariithi said.Mr Etirikia said a majority of MCAs were with Munya because he was key to their political survival because of the projects in their wards.Mr Etirikia said MCAs &lsquo;guns&rsquo; should be trained on Senator Kiraitu Murungi because he was out to cripple Munya&rsquo;s political ambitions.&ldquo;The governor&rsquo;s position requires a youthful person and Munya is that. The senator should &lsquo;play at the national level&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Etirikia said he would join Party of National Unity (PNU) which Munya is poised to take over, and use it to run for re-election, as he is opposed to the Jubilee Party.Mr Kithinji said Munya had initiated many water, roads and health projects, and should be given a second term so that he can do even more.Munya assured residents that he would present his candidature as party leader during the PNU&rsquo;s national delegates conference slated for September 9 at Bomas of Kenya.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will use it to run for governor in 2017, and the presidency in 2022,&rdquo; he said.Previously, Munya said&nbsp;he was in talks with people who wished to partner with him in his quest to give Meru a party that would enhance the region&rsquo;s bargaining power.He vowed not to be intimidated into joining President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s political outfit Jubilee Party.
