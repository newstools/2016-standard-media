Senators appear to have formed a common front to oust governors in next year&rsquo;s elections.Besides piling pressure on the governors to account for billions of shillings entrusted to them for development of their counties, the Senators now want to support their colleagues seeking gubernatorial seats. They exhibited this in Kisumu on Friday, where four CORD senators Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o, (Kisumu), Hassan Omar (Mombasa), James Orengo (Siaya) and Moses Kajwang&rsquo; ( Homa Bay) sensationally claimed governors had nothing to show for their four years in office.They joined Prof Nyong&rsquo;o as he launched his campaign to oust Governor Jack Ranguma during which they tore into the governors, saying they were a disappointment to Kenyans. They singled out governors from ODM strongholds who they accused of doing little to show the commitment of the party in showcasing the successes of devolution which Party leader Raila Odinga has been fighting for.They endorsed Nyong&rsquo;o saying he is best suited to effectively tackle the county&rsquo;s affairs. Also in attendance was Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga who has also declared her decision to run against her boss. The leaders said the incumbent leaders have failed to champion the purpose of devolution.Senator Omar said: &ldquo;Devolution has been squandered by marauding governors who neither know the value of devolved units nor appreciate it.&ldquo;We shall not allow the promise (of devolution) to be procrastinated one more time. If it means a battle in Kisumu or anywhere else, we will help each other to root out the current governments so that we can fulfill this promise,&rdquo; Omar said.He said Kenyans continue to languish in poverty because of poor policies and bad governance.He accused governors of rampant graft in counties, which he claimed is greatly to blame for delayed implementation of devolution to benefit the wananchi.&ldquo;When you steal from us at the counties, you are not different from the Jubilee Government that steals from us at the national level,&rdquo; he said.Senator James Orengo said there was a vacuum in most of the gubernatorial offices. &ldquo;Do you want a governor who understands that his responsibilities is bringing services to the people or one who keeps all the resources to himself,&rdquo; he posed.He urged the electorates to pick leaders with impressive scorecards like Nyong&rsquo;o who was one of the crafters of devolution.He urged the electorate to come out and register in large numbers, saying a new register was on the way to turnaround the electoral process for improved credibility.Other senators who have openly declared interest in the county seats mainly to &ldquo;correcting things&rdquo; include Michael Mbuvi alias Sonko (Nairobi), Bonny Khalwale (Kakamega), Kiraitu Murungi (Meru) and John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot).They have also attacked governors in their respective counties, accusing them of failing to champion devolution.Top ODM officials in the county led by deputy organising secretary Rosa Buyu threw their weight behind Nyong&rsquo;o. Some 13 MCAs also attended the ceremony, earlier blessed by elders from the locality.
