Former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru will run for governor.Ms Waiguru announced the move at a Kerugoya hotel saying after making landmark achievements in various development projects while in the Civil Service, time was now ripe to venture into politics. &quot;I have served this country successfully as a technocrat and my track record speaks for itself. It&#39;s the high time I switched gears and served as a politician and I promise residents they will reap benefits from my servant-people leadership,&quot; she said.She said having been tested and proved suitable in the Civil Service, she would now serve in the new capacity with due diligence.Accompanied by Ms Purity Wangui Ngirichi, who has declared her intention to vie for Woman Representative, Waiguru said Kirinyaga people deserve a committed team.&quot;Time has come for this great county to be served by selfless leaders who are committed to turning around the slow development rate that has persisted for a long time,&quot; she said.Waiguru said those with eyes are never told to see and those doubting her entry into the mucky world of politics should just wait and see what she has in store.&quot;I want to see a county where patients are not asked to bring blankets or water buckets since this is not only primitive but a sign of backwardness,&quot; she said. At the same time, Ms Wangui said if elected she would ensure women and the youth were economically empowered.She said she will ensure Kirinyaga got its rightful place at the national arena unlike now when it comes after the rest.She claimed those in office have neglected their representative roles and opted to play the second fiddle at the expense of the electorate.&quot;My main task is to come up with as many programmes as possible where women and the youth who are marginalised can have their economic well being improved,&quot; she said.Elected leaders in Kirinyaga snubbed Waiguru&#39;s launch. The Saturday meeting only attracted about 15 aspiring MCAs and also an aspiring senator Joseph Mwaniki.None of the four MPs from the area, nor the 20 elected and nine nominated MCAs turned up to grace the occasion. Some leaders said Waiguru should cut her own political niche if she is serious on winning the gubernatorial position.&nbsp;Although some think her entry into the gubernatorial race might have changed the area political equation, others feel she has started on the wrong foot.&quot;Where were men and women of integrity to grace her crucial meeting which was meant to create a permanent positive impression to last throughout the electioneering campaigns, and where were the members of the area council of elders?&quot; posed Moses Njuki, a voter.Mr Njuki said Waiguru should have been received at the meeting by respected men and women from all corners of the county since the position she is aspiring for belongs to residents of Kirinyaga County.&quot;But what we saw at the meeting were just hired boda boda operators and some aspiring MCAs, mainly from Mwea sub-county and a few from Karumandi ward, which is currently represented by Josiah Munene,&quot; Njuki said.
