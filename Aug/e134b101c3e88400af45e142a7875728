Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory skin disorder.Skin cells normally take three to four weeks to replace themselves, but in people with psoriasis, this process takes only three to six days. Because this replacement process is much faster, both dead and new cells build up on the skin, causing flaky, crusty patches that shed easily. These patches can be very itchy, sore and sometimes produce a burning sensation on the skin.The goal of treatment in psoriasis is usually to slow down the production of cells and reduce inflammation and a healthy diet goes a long way towards making this happen.Some approaches that are used include:Weight loss: Several studies have linked obesity to an increased severity of symptoms in psoriasis. This could be because fat cells in the skin produce protein cells that trigger inflammation. In this case, reducing unwanted weight will help reduce inflammation.Heart-Friendly Diet: People with psoriasis are usually at high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. This is another incentive for weight management. Nevertheless, eating a heart friendly diet is recommended. Indulge in low cholesterol foods and food stuffs that are low in unhealthy fat.Anti-inflammatory diet: Reduce inflammation by eating foods that have Vitamin A, Beta carotene, Zinc, Omega 3 fatty acids and Vitamin E.One can easily get these by eating fresh and brightly coloured fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, cold water fish and oily fish. Reduce intake of high fat foods, refined and processed foods as they increase inflammation.
