Kisumu, Kenya: The Police and Prison departments have launched a major&nbsp; security&nbsp; operation in Kisumu as they pursued&nbsp; four &#39;dangerous&#39; convicted criminals,&nbsp; who had escaped&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Kibos&nbsp; Prison at dawn.Among those on the run was&nbsp; a hard core&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; who&nbsp; had&nbsp; been indicted&nbsp; for killing a fellow&nbsp; inmate. The jailbirds broke out of prisons by cutting the window grills of their cell before climbing over the five meter-high prison perimeter wall using blankets and sheets, according to Nyanza regional prisons commander Amos Misik.The four were serving jail terms ranging from 20 years&nbsp; to Life imprisonment.Mr Misik said the prisoners used what is believed to be a hack saw to cut the metallic grills, leaving behind two fellow inmates. He however added that they did not recover any leads at the scene but investigations were on.&quot;Our sentries spotted them jumping over the wall and fired three shots but they managed to escape,&quot; he said, &quot;We have launched investigations to establish how they managed to cut the grills.&quot;He said they were interrogating the two inmates who remained behind as they seek to unearth how the escape which seemed to have been &quot;carefully plotted&quot; happened.He added that they were also investigating how the tool used to cut the grills entered the highly guarded prison. He did not rule out collusion with the warders.&nbsp;&nbsp;
