President Uhuru Kenyatta has lobbied MPs to endorse a report detailing a raft of electoral reforms before next year&rsquo;s elections.Uhuru yesterday received the report of the joint parliamentary select committee on IEBC, a day after Opposition leader Raila Odinga, too, backed the political settlement reached by both sides after month-long talks. The report was tabled in the National Assembly and Senate yesterday as the leadership of both coalitions rallied for its adoption without amendments.Earlier, the committee had also handed over the report to the House leadership with two appendages, the draft Bills seeking to amend the Election law and the Elections Offences law during a ceremony at Parliament yesterday.President Kenyatta also championed expeditious consideration of the report by Parliament in accordance with parliamentary procedures and practice.&ldquo;This report is a product of consensus. I have received the report of the committee and commend members for their exemplary work delivered against a background of tight deadlines,&rdquo; noted the Head of State.He went on: &ldquo;I applaud the members for their bipartisan approach in addressing all matters relating to the IEBC. Members of Parliament should also apply the same spirit in addressing all matters of national importance.&rdquo;Uhuru said the process of recruitment and appointment of new commissioners should start urgently to ensure the August 8, 2017 General Election is conducted on schedule by a polls body that enjoys broad confidence of Kenyans.He emphasised on the need for new commissioners to assume office within the agreed constitutional and statutory timelines in order to deliver free, fair and credible elections.POLITICAL SETTLEMENTOn Wednesday, Opposition leader Raila Odinga asked members of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) to approve the report that details the negotiated political settlement.He further said the envisaged reforms would give all players confidence and result in a free, fair and credible poll.&ldquo;The most difficult bit has been completed by this committee. It&rsquo;s now just a matter of picking the commissioners,&rdquo; said the CORD leader in reference to concerns that the September 30 deadline to have new electoral commissioners in office is ambitious.Yesterday, committee co-chairmen senators Kiraitu Murungi (Meru) and James Orengo (Siaya), while handing over the report to the leadership of both Houses, underscored the need for MPs to extend the goodwill demonstrated by representatives of the two coalitions during the month-long talks.They said once the report is tabled before the National Assembly and Senate, the lawmakers should also move with speed to pass it and the two Bills to guarantee the country a free, fair and credible election on August 8, next year.Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki (Tharaka Nithi) and his Minority counterpart Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Bungoma), National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale (Garissa Township) and his Minority counterpart Francis Nyenze (Kitui West) were present to receive the document.They reiterated the need for lawmakers to unanimously support the committee&rsquo;s work.&ldquo;We developed this report and Bills through consensus. The recommendations we have come up with are geared towards ensuring the country holds free, fair and transparent polls next year.&ldquo;The onus now is on the House leadership to rally members to support and pass it without amendments,&rdquo; said Kiraitu.TOTAL SUPPORTKindiki, Wetang&rsquo;ula, Duale and Nyenze assured Kenyans of their commitment to lobby for the passage of the report in Parliament, affirming the total support from their respective principals.&ldquo;I am a proud Kenyan. The process started on a very painful note, I personally regret what happened before the committee was formed. It was needless to subject Kenyans to what we did (street protests). This committee has been very professional and gave Kenyans the confidence along the way,&rdquo; said Kindiki.He in particular lauded the role played by the Church to bring the two sides to the negotiation table, acknowledging that this helped a lot.Wetang&rsquo;ula also concurred with colleagues, saying CORD was satisfied with the committee&rsquo;s work and would fully back the report.Orengo and Kiraitu stressed that Parliament must now move with speed to beat the September 30 deadline to replace IEBC commissioners.The Siaya senator said the legislators should keep up with the momentum to finish the task.
