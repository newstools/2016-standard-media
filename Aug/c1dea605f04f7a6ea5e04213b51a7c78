Bananas are harvested green and begin to ripen as soon as the stem is cut from the plant. Normally, farmers use all manner of methods to hasten the ripening.The disadvantage of these traditional methods is that the process takes too long. Little wonder some unsrcupulous traders use harmful chemicals to hasten the process. But a student&rsquo;s innovation offers a ripe solution for this problem.The innovation which has been patented, is a brainchild of Stephen Simotwo, a final year Agricultural Engineering student at Kaiboi Technical Training Institute in Nandi County.The Banana Ripening Box uses a simple technology that modifies conditions for ripening of the fruit in a safe and fast way.&ldquo;This simple technology guarantees ripening of bananas within three days of harvesting compared to the traditional method where farmers use gunny bags in a process that takes between seven and 14 days,&rdquo; says Emmanuel Seroney, innovations supervisor at the institute.The box is cost-effective because it does not use electricity and is portable.AFFORDABLEMr Seroney explains that the wooden box uses organic gas ethylene extracted from passion fruits to stimulate ripening.&ldquo;This innovation does not change the nature of bananas unlike the traditional method where the fruits get broken when stuffed into gunny bags.There are no chemicals involved in this process hence consumers are guaranteed of safety,&rdquo; says Seroney.Given that the traditional methods of ripening take long, some unscrupulous traders use calcium carbide to ripen bananas thus exposing consumers to cancer causing agents.&ldquo;But this innovation ensures fruits are naturally ripened in a very hygienic manner. The fruit also remain in good shape adding to their market value,&rdquo; Seroney explains.So what inspired the student to come up with this innovation?&ldquo;I come from a region where banana growing is common. I found out that farmers face a lot of challenges using traditional methods of ripening bananas.For instance, the method where fruits are put in bags and tied in warm areas like above fire place lead to breakages thus causing losses,&rdquo; says Simotwo.Additionally, points out, covering the bananas in grass exposes them to pathogens and insects leading to losses. Determined to come up with a simpler solution, he embarked on research.Simotwo started by experimenting with harvested vegetables. He learnt that ethylene gas (fruits ripening gas that is naturally occurring)can also be triggered by other processes.&ldquo;I realised passion fruit has the highest concentration of ethylene during ripening stages. A mixture of passion fruits and bananas in the box guarantees full ripening of bananas within three days,&rdquo; says Simotwo.NO CHEMICALSThe inventor says the Banana Ripening Box is made of wood with apartments inside and lined with a transparent polythene and is airtight. It can be designed to any desired size depending on the need.To use it is simple, he explains.A farmer or trader places green bananas evenly in the ripening box that contains passion fruits that are ripe, which produces ethylene gas.The trick he says is the rations. For instance for 300 pieces of bananas, you place a kilo of passion fruits.The box is then closed for 24 hours airtight to prevent ethylene gas from escaping. This triggers the ripening process.The box is then opened for five minutes to release carbon dioxide.Afterwards the bananas change from starch to simple sugar and they begin to turn yellow.The box is again closed for 12 hours to allow continuity of ripening. Opening is again done for five minutes and then finally it is shut for close to 72 hours and the process is complete.MASS PRODUCTIONIn the absence of passion fruits, other one can use tomatoes, avocadoes, pawpaws, pineapples to produce ethylene.For farmers who are interested, Peter Bor, the chairman innovation at the institute, says the institution is in the process of undertaking mass production of the Banana Ripening Box.&ldquo;We are targeting farmers, consumers and traders of bananas in regions including Nandi, Kisii, Uasin Gishu, Kakamega, Trans Nzoia, Kericho and Elgeyo Marakwet counties.The ripening box is suitable for families who buy large volumes of fruits and want to keep for long, super markets among others,&rdquo; says Bor.On average, he says a small box costs Sh5,000 and a big one Sh15,000.Charles Koech, the Principal Kaiboi TTI lauds the innovation saying the institution has created a conducive environment for students to come up with such brilliant innovations.&ldquo;As an institution, we encourage innovation and urge other stakeholders and partners in the technical field to team up and support innovators,&rdquo; says Koech.The principal says the institution has created a favourable environmnent for students and researchers to make new innovations, especially those that have potential to change fortunes of farmers.He says several projects unveiled through their innovations department have been patented which encourages students to come up with new discoveries.
