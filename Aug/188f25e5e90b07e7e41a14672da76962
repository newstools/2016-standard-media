The government has been urged to waive taxes on condom imports. Kenya&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Stephen Karau, said it is a known fact that condoms are key in HIV prevention.&nbsp;He spoke yesterday at the Kiambu Golf Club during a tournament by AIDS Healthcare Foundation to create awareness on treatment, prevention and management of the virus. &ldquo;We have put more emphasis on prevention by giving out free condoms and we are negotiating with government to have duty tax waived.&nbsp;This would ensure more Kenyans are reached,&rdquo; said Karau. &ndash;&mdash;Graham Kajilwa
