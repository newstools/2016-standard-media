The battle for the gubernatorial has seen key aspirants seeking to forge a common front against Governor Alfred Mutua.It remains to be seen whether Dr Mutua, who has rebelled against Wiper party and its leadership and launched&nbsp; Maendeleo Chap Chap and Unity movement, will withstand the brewing political storm. It also remains to be seen whether his opponents will pass the test of unity, which has been billed as the only way to send home the governor, who has on severally earned the tag of &ldquo;best performing governor in the country&rdquo;.Former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti, Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala and an East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) MP Peter Mathuki have all declared interest in becoming the next governor of Ukambani&rsquo;s richest county.Ms Wavinya, the Chama Cha Uzalendo (CCU) party leader, was Mutua&rsquo;s fiercest challenger in the 2013 General Election. She later unsuccessfully petitioned Mutua&rsquo;s election on claims that the governor was &ldquo;unlawfully elected&rdquo;.Mr Kiala, who was Mutua&rsquo;s running mate and subsequently his deputy governor, fell out with his boss after the governor accused him of holding clandestine meetings with MCAs in a bid to oust him. Kiala was later impeached by the County Assembly but got a lifeline after the Senate overturned his impeachment.Mr Mathuki, who was nominated by Wiper party to EALA, has been actively involved in the party&rsquo;s affairs, and is currently Wiper&rsquo;s deputy secretary general.The three aspirants have rolled up their sleeves and declared a political war against Mutua, who won the 2013 election by a landslide.Yesterday, both Wavinya and Kiala maintained they were in the race and indicated that they were not opposed to the idea of working together.FORGE UNITY&ldquo;I am firmly in the race for Machakos governor but that fact does not mean I should play in isolation. For me, the common goal would be to forge unity for Machakos residents and by extension the Kamba community,&rdquo; said Wavinya.Asked if she would join forces with Kiala in order to beat Mutua as widely speculated, she said: &ldquo;It is not about Wavinya or Kiala, but about our political parties. Kiala is in Wiper and I am in CCU. I would not be opposed to inter-parties consultations towards that end,&rdquo; said the former Youth Affairs Assistant Minister.She admitted that her party had been engaging in consultations with Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka with a view to finding a political compromise to unite the Kamba.Her sentiments were echoed by Kiala, who upheld the possibility of working together especially to wrestle the seat from Mutua.&ldquo;I cannot rule out the possibility of working together with my sister Wavinya especially if by so doing we will be assured of giving the people of Machakos the leadership they deserve,&rdquo; he said.Kiala claimed the concept of devolution had terribly failed in the county due to lack of political goodwill by Mutua&rsquo;s administration.Mathuki also confirmed that he will be in the team that aims to &ldquo;bring change in Machakos County through transformative leadership&rdquo;. But he accused Mutua and his deputy of wasting their golden opportunity to serve the people of Machakos.&ldquo;The people of Machakos gave those two an opportunity to govern, but unfortunately they engaged in fighting for selfish interests. In my view, we in Wiper cannot afford to make more mistakes and as a party we are prepared to reclaim the seat since Mutua has declared he will not defend his on the party&rsquo;s ticket,&rdquo; said Mathuki.He disclosed that Wiper was &lsquo;very concerned&rsquo; about the fate of Machakos governor seat and will do &ldquo;whatever it takes&rdquo; to ensure the seat is retained by Wiper.&ldquo;Losing the Machakos gubernatorial seat would mean closing down the party and that cannot happen,&rdquo; he told The Standard on phone yesterday.But Mutua has rubbished the political drums of war being sounded by his opponents and maintained that he has served the people of Machakos with diligence.CHEAP POLITICKING&ldquo;The least I can expect is that the people of Machakos will re-elect me based on my performance. In the meantime I will remain unmoved by cheap politicking by those who are envious of my government&rsquo;s achievements and are trying to attract public sympathy,&rdquo; Mutua said through his press secretary Mutinda Mwanzia.He said numerous aspects of devolution against which he has been accused of failing to meet, were visible throughout the entire county.&ldquo;For instance, the Machakos level 5 Hospital has become a centre for health tourism where MCAs from other counties have visited for benchmarking. We have also upgraded over 30 health centres and equipped them with drugs,&rdquo; he added.Other areas where Mutua has defended his legacy include water projects, roads and security.He ruled out the possibility of defending his seat on a Wiper ticket, claiming the party could rig him out.
