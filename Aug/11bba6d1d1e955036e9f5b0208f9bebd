A woman is nursing serious wounds after her husband allegedly stabbed her seven times on Monday in Kuria West sub-county.Christine Mbusiro said she was attacked by Adrian Musotiro, her spouse of 12 years, barely an hour after they left the chief&#39;s camp where they had been taken to resolve a marital conflict. The mother of three is admitted at Akidiva Mabera Hospital in Kuria West sub-county.Ms Mbusiro told The Standard she had separated from her husband for a while and had rented a house in Nyabohanze.She said her husband, accompanied by Administration Police officers from Mabera, came to her house on Friday morning and took her to the camp. Her father was also summoned.Tagare location chief Jones Buhune said the three came to his office but he told them to come back on Monday after failing to find a solution.&quot;They came back on Monday, but after deliberations we agreed that the two stay separated for a while and further agreed that they appear before the district officer where they were to sign an agreement to that effect,&quot; he explained.The victim said a few minutes after leaving the chief&#39;s office, Mr Musotiro, who was armed with a knife, waylaid her and stabbed her several times before her screams attracted residents, and the suspect fled.The chief said the man was later brought to his camp by his own father.&quot;I then called one Inspector Kanyi who has an office in the same compound and handed the suspect over to him,&quot; said Mr Buhune.He, however, said the AP claimed the suspect who had a small cut on his hand needed to receive treatment first.&quot;I told him to book in the suspect first because the injury was just a small cut but he insisted and gave him to two officers to take him to hospital,&quot; added Buhune.The woman&#39;s brother, Charles Nyamwini, claimed the same Inspector Kanyi asked him for Sh3,000 before he could release a vehicle to transport the suspect to the nearby Sirare police station.&quot;He asked me for Sh3,000, but I did not have that kind of money. Barely an hour later, I was told the suspect had escaped,&quot; Mnyamini said.The allegations were confirmed by Buhune, who said the woman&#39;s brother told him he had been asked for money.&quot;After Nyamwini&#39;s confesion, I called the Sirare police station OCS and requested for a vehicle. The suspect had been taken to a clinic and I was waiting for them to return. The officer returned without him, claiming he had escaped,&quot; the chief said.&nbsp;At Mabera AP post, an AP officer claimed the suspect was not handed over to him.&quot;He was injured and we could not arrest him before he was treated. We had not officially taken the suspect from the chief because had we done that, we would have booked him,&quot; he said.Chief Buhune however insisted the man had no injuries save for the small cut he had on his finger.&quot;I personally checked him for injuries and there were none. His clothes were stained with blood probably because he was struggling with his wife as he stabbed her,&quot; the chief said.Tagare assistant Chief Joseph Mugosi said he was convinced the man was freed by the two officers. The victim&#39;s family now wants justice.
