We have planned for a mammoth crowd,&rdquo; he said.Two weeks ago in a televised address to the nation, Uhuru announced that the JP constituent parties will dissolve in simultaneous National Delegates Conferences and subsequently hold its first National Delegate Convention. Already 14 parties have declared interest to dissolve.On a Tuesday meeting at La Mada Hotel in Nairobi, officials of the parties presented their lists of delegates.It is expected that close to Sh500 million will be spent in the event. The expenditure will include facilitation of the delegates for food and accommodation, payment for international guests from the various parties across the globe and the artists.Banners with the party colours, T-shirts, caps, decoration for the parties&rsquo; events and the eventual final convention are also expected to take up much of the funds. Uhuru and Deputy will be the chief guests.In the programme that has been finalised, on September 8, parties will hold their in-house meetings, with a sole agenda of ratifying the dissolution of the political vehicles ahead of the merger.On the second day, guests, including the steering committee co-chairmen, leaders from various regions, MPs and senators, will address the delegates and National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale will be the keynote speaker.Kiraitu said Uhuru will be declared the party leader and Ruto his deputy deputise him in the party hierarchy that will include close to a hundred positions.Uhuru will be the main speaker on the final day.
