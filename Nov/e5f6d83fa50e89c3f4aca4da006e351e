The Kenya Society for the Blind (KSB) has said the cost of learning equipment for the visually impaired is too high. The society has also noted that despite 80 per cent of blindness being preventable, rarely do affected persons seek early treatment when symptoms set in. KSB Director Juliana Kivasu said despite the treatment for cataracts - the leading cause of blindness in the country - being fairly affordable, not many people go for surgery. &quot;It is possible that due to lack of awareness, many do not get to access surgery, which is just Sh5,000 in public hospitals,&quot; said Ms Kivasu. She said people with eye ailments could now access eye drops easily after the society lobbied to have them&nbsp; provided for free in public hospitals. &quot;The biggest challenge is that many people are not aware of these developments. We would not like people to go blind as our main agenda is to prevent blindness,&quot; she said. Kivasu also said the high cost of learning equipment for the visually impaired was a major challenge in accessing education. Whereas a simple geometrical set for mainstream students costs as little as Sh300, the same equipment for a visually impaired person costs Sh5,000. &quot;A pen costs Sh20 for mainstream students while braille goes for Sh85,000 and has to be imported. This is very expensive and that is why we always need partners,&quot; she said. Kivasu was speaking during the annual walk for the blind, which was flagged off by Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu yesterday. It was organised in partnership with The Standard Group. The walk is used to sensitise road users to always give right of way to persons who are visually impaired. &quot;The Constitution is very open and categorical on the different treatment that should be accorded to the disabled,&quot; said Justice Mwilu.
