BEIJING:&nbsp;Donald Trump&#39;s upset election victory cracks open pressing strategic and economic questions in U.S.-China ties, and has likely surprised and worried Chinese leaders, who prize stability in relations between the two powers. Trump had lambasted China throughout the campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator his first day in office. He has also questioned U.S. security commitments to allies and undercut long-held bipartisan U.S. foreign policy norms, such as suggesting that Japan develop nuclear weapons, all stances that if he follows through on could upset the regional security balance in Asia. That unpredictability is not an ideal election outcome for China&#39;s stability-obsessed Communist Party, especially as it seeks smooth U.S. relations at a time of daunting reform challenges at home, a slowing economy, and a leadership reshuffle of its own that will put a new party elite around President Xi Jinping in late 2017. Beijing tends to prefer incumbent party successors with consistent policy lines. Trump&#39;s lack of a governance track record and his unorthodox take on long-held Republican priorities could prove a headache for Chinese officials. Jia Qingguo, the dean of the School of International Relations at China&#39;s elite Peking University and a government advisor, called Trump &quot;a symbol of uncertainty&quot;.

Decades of Hillary Clinton&#39;s criticism of China&#39;s human rights record and her insistence on U.S. interests in the South China Sea have made her a well-known, and not well-liked figure among Beijing&#39;s ruling elite. Chinese experts say some in Beijing believe Trump will prove a pragmatic businessman, willing to deal with China. &quot;Any type of protectionist policy pursued will be a double-edged sword,&quot; said Ruan Zongze, a former Chinese diplomat now with the China Institute of International Studies, a think-tank affiliated with the Foreign Ministry. &quot;I think he will be very careful about this,&quot; Moreover, Trump&#39;s criticism of U.S. allies, including Japan, for free-riding on U.S. security guarantees, has offered China the tantalizing prospect of an American retrenchment from Asia.
