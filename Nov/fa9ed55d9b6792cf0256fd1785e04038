A man was killed by elephants in Masai Mara even as cases of human-wildlife conflict increase. County Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) senior warden Collins Omondi said the deceased, Mokolo ole Soit, was driving his livestock to a watering point when he was accosted by the jumbos. Mr Omondi told&nbsp;The Standard&nbsp;the octogenarian was unable to escape the ordeal and was instantly killed. &quot;The incident happened when the old man was taking his livestock to Nkoilale river near Naibosho wildlife conservancy when he was ambushed by the elephants in the nearby bush,&quot;said Omondi. Last week, a 76-year-old man was trampled to death by a herd of elephants at Sekenani area around the Masai Mara Game Reserve. The incident comes at a time when two other people, among them a Belgian national and a pupil living with disability, were crushed to death by elephants in separate incidents at Sekenani and Siana areas bordering the park.
