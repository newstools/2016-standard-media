Women politicians want ODM to reduce nomination fees for female aspirants by 50 per cent.The Orange party had stipulated nomination fees for election hopefuls as follows: MCA&nbsp;Sh25,000; senator, Woman representative and MP&nbsp;Sh250,000,&nbsp;governor&nbsp;Sh500,000 and&nbsp;Sh1 million for president. But at least 100 women eyeing various elective positions on ODM tickets in the county asked the party to reduce the fees to increase the number of women in political leadership.Speaking during a leadership training session organised by Action Aid in Homa Bay over the weekend, the women said a shortage of resources was the main obstacle in their search for seeking elective posts.According to Lorna Owino, who is vying for the Gembe MCA seat in Mbita, and Joan Ogada who is contesting the same position in Kojwach in Kabondo Kasipul constituency, the majority of women were put off by a lack of funds.&quot;Many women are ready to vie for elective posts but the main challenge is limited finances. We are requesting our party to reduce the nomination fees for women aspirants to half of what their male counterparts should pay,&quot; Ms Owino said.Ms Ogada said women who held leadership roles had demonstrated good qualities and told local residents to trust women more.&quot;Women have the ability to lead, which is why the matter of fees should be handled carefully to enable us to vie elective positions,&quot; Ogada added.Arujo MCA aspirant Amina Ismael said a reduction of the nomination fees would make it easier for ODM to achieve the two-thirds gender rule.&quot;We are also appealing to our security personnel and those in charge of party nominations to weed out hooliganism, which some men use as a tactic to intimidate women during elections,&quot; she said.Nominated MCA Caroline Owidhi, who is contesting the Kagan MCA seat, said their intention was to spearhead a paradigm shift so that women could expecting nomination.&quot;We want women to compete fairly against the men,&quot; said Ms Owidhi.
