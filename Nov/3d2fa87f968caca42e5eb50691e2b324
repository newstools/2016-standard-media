&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} Paris:French police are hunting for a man after finding a woman dead in a retirement home in southern France where some 60 Roman Catholic missionaries live, but they have ruled out any link to Islamist terrorism, a prosecutor said on Friday. &quot;At this stage we can&#39;t say exactly what the perpetrator&#39;s motive was, but what we can say is that there is no link, none at all, with Islamist terrorism,&quot; Montpellier prosecutor Christophe Barret told reporters. Security forces were called to the home in Montferrier-sur-Lez, about 10 km (6 miles) north of Montpellier, late on Thursday, after a woman who had been bound and gagged freed herself and escaped from the home. On entering the building, police found the body of a 54-year-old linen maid who had been stabbed several times, Barret said. He said investigators had found a car near the scene of the crime that contained a replica firearm and other materials that enabled them to identify a suspect.

The home houses retired missionaries who had worked in Africa as well as a few nuns. France has been under a state of emergency since a wave of Islamist attacks last year. Suspects arrested last weekend under anti-terrorism measures had been planning to launch attacks on Dec. 1 at landmark sites in and around Paris, a source said on Thursday.
