The plight of former athlete Daniel Kipchirchir Komen, who had his hard-earned money wiped out in unclear circumstances, is only the tip of the rhinoceros&#39; horn. Komen reportedly lost Sh21 million in a business deal with a lawyer he says was his confidant. Although the case is before court, the bottom line is that today, the former Kenyan athlete has nothing to show for his sweat and the pain he endured earning his fortune, let alone sacrificing time when he would have been with his family, to bring honour to Kenya. Most athletes have been accused of not thinking about their future. In Komen&rsquo;s case, however, just like others before him, the athlete had the presence of mind to invest his earnings into real estate through somebody he trusted. Granted, most athletes do not have financial management literacy to enable them make informed choices. And, even if they had, running is demanding and therefore they would not have time, which makes them turn to professionals. It is unfortunate and deplorable that those trusted by our world beaters often let them down. Komen&rsquo;s case calls for the Government and the Law Society of Kenya to look into the matter lest other athletes lose faith in society. If that happens, we risk sending heroes and heroines on the road to destruction.
