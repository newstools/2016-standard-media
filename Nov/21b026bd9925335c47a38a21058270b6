A man and his estranged wife were yesterday found hanging from ropes in their one-roomed house in Githurai 44, Nairobi. Shocked neighbours said even though the couple had been experiencing domestic problems, they did not expect their differences to end in deaths. They described the early morning incident as &lsquo;unexpected&rsquo; considering the couple had two young children. Neighbours said they found the two bodies dangling by ropes tightly tied around their necks. The ropes had been fastened to the window grilles.&nbsp; Kiambu OCPD&nbsp;Duncan Ngutu said preliminary investigations had shown 38-year-old Simon Maina may have killed his estranged wife Esther Muthoni,41, before taking his own life in what he may have planned to pass off as double suicide.&nbsp; However, in a suicide note found in the house, the two said they should be buried together. The note also indicated the two wanted their parents to take care of their two children.
