Financial transactions by departments go through various stages before reaching treasury via Ifmis and internet banking. Mr Konde explained that there are usually five passwords in a department to transact documents. Under Ifmis, a transaction undergoes invoicing, validation, approval by the chief officer and the accountant before payment.
