Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&#39;ula has welcomed Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi to CORD so that they can form a formidable force to unseat Jubilee government from power next year.Speaking Saturday at Mabanga Agricultural Training Institute during the closure of the Bukusu Council of Elders seminar, Wetang&#39;ula said the formation of the National Alliance party is the way to go.&quot;I welcome my brother Mudavadi to CORD so that we can form a force to reckon with we have to ensure that Jubilee administration is sent parking, we can&#39;t tolerate tribalism and corruption that has rocked their administration, we are tired,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula. He said that talks were at an advanced stage for the formation of the National Alliance party and it will be easier for them to dislodge Jubilee leaders from power provided he is nominated as the opposition presidential candidate.The Ford Kenya party leader noted that he has what it takes to be the opposition&#39;s presidential candidate and will ensure that he defeats Jubilee leaders in the next general elections.&quot;Am ripe enough, having been in politics for long and understanding this country&#39;s terrain very well I stand the chance to beat President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto hands down,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula.The senate minority leader said that CORD leaders will remain united up to the last minute to ensure that Jubilee is sent home for failing to contain corruption that is hurting majority Kenyans.He said that the ongoing corruption at Afya house and the National Youth Services is a great set back that only the CORD administration can stop and streamline everything.&quot;Billions of money is ending up in individual&#39;s pockets yet the President and his deputy are silent, they should come out boldly and sack the suspects involved in diverting cash meant for various projects that can benefit majority Kenyans,&quot; he said.His sentiment were echoed by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa who said that they are putting in place measures that will see the Jubilee administration does not stay in power.&quot;Kenyans should register in large numbers and vote in CORD leaders, this is the only democratic process that will help us unseat them from power, they are not keen in fighting corruption or tribalism which is the main undoing of this country, once we ascend to power we will deal with all corrupt individuals,&quot; said Wamalwa.
