Construction of the Sh4 billion Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) headquarters in Kisumu is set to resume after a 10-year delay. According to Ali Matano, the LVBC executive secretary, the Secretariat is sourcing for funds to put up the regional offices and had established a kitty for line ministries to mobilise funds from various foundations. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are expected to share the costs, with amendments planned on the commission&rsquo;s founding frameworks planned to rope in Rwanda and Burundi. This comes after nearly a decade of failed resource mobilisation that left the commission ineffective in meeting its mandates on the Lake Victoria Basin.
