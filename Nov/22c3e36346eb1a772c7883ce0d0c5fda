The Government has been called upon to collaborate with the private sector in the management of diabetes. Danish Ambassador Mette Knudsen said partnership will ensure sustainability in the fight against diabetes, which has been reported in children and adults. She said support for local health authorities in ensuring that insulin is easily accessible and affordable to the middle and low income patients is needed. She was speaking yesterday at Nakuru&rsquo;s Level Five Hospital during the launch of Centre of Excellence in Diabetes Care. &ldquo;The only sure way we can manage diabetes is through partnership and the establishment of more clinics to ensure early diagnosis,&rdquo; she observed. A research conducted by Novo Nordisk in 2015, shows that about 478,000 adults aged between 20 and 79 years in the country have diabetes. -Mercy Kahenda READ MORE New study shows cancer knows tribe Trade will continue to define America-Kenya relations Conserve Tsavo and empower neighbouring Kenyan communities
