A South African firm challenging the Sh2.5 billion ballot papers printing tender has lost its case against the electoral commission. Paarl Media (Pty) Ltd, a subsidiary of Novus Holdings Ltd, yesterday suffered a major setback after Public Procurement Administrative Review Board dismissed its case against the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission (IEBC). First, the board noted the firm did not meet requirements set out by the commission in the tendering process and that two men who claimed to be Paarl&#39;s representatives, a Mr Ben Sachs and a Dr Shailesh Patel, had no authority to do so. &quot;The application is hereby dismissed and the procuring entity is to proceed with the process within the law,&quot; board chairman Paul Gicheru said yesterday. It also emerged the papers filed before the tribunal did not have supporting affidavit from the firm&#39;s directors. Instead, it was their lawyer who had filed his affidavit in support of the case. This, the tribunal noted, was against the law.
