USA: With less than seven days to the charged US elections, the two-horse race between the main presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appears to stiffen by the day.The gap between the Republican and Democratic contender has since narrowed following last Friday&#39;s new email scandal by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which has put Clinton&#39;s perceived early lead in jeopardy.As candidates edged towards the homestretch of the campaigns in readiness for next Tuesday&#39;s polls, the Justice Department seizure of Clinton&#39;s emails saga. For Clinton, despite calling for full disclosure on the probe, this latest revelation appears to bridge the gap between her and fierce rival, Trump.Already, the FBI has received warrant to proceed with the probe on Clinton&#39;s private emails when she was Secretary of State in President Barack Obama&#39;s administration.The election has sparked debate on whether the two choices by the main political parties were the best, flying in the face of the most controversial exercise in the history of US.Some of those who spoke to the Standard hinted that they might not participate in the November 8th elections, since both the two candidates are unpopular.&quot;Both candidates are not favorable to me. Neither do I support the three other candidates. I would rather not cast my vote on the election day,&quot; said Ray Hutt, a taxi driver.In Virginia State, which is a swing vote State after President Obama broke the tradition since 1964 has seen locals vote in Republicans, the new email dossier is becoming a game changer in Cinton&#39;s presidential bid.&quot;Virginia has been a Republican State since 1964. It&#39;s a battle ground states because it&#39;s a swing vote State for both the candidates,&quot; said Dave Hendrickson, Government and Sunday Editor at Daily Press in Newport News, Virgina.He admits that this coming election is a no ordinary exercise.The State has two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and three in the House of Representatives, while Republican has eight representatives.With over 30 years experienced in US election coverage, the contest between Trump and Clinton cannot be out rightly determined by just mere opinion polls.&quot;Virgina is next to Washington DC, its population is largely conservative. This was a Republican State but President Obama was able to break this tradition by bringing on board the growing young population that is mainly liberal to support the Democrats. Clinton has been leading in the past polls, however with the current emails backlash, the remaining days will be a main determinant,&quot; said Hendrickson.PolitiFact staff writer John Greenberg argued that in this election, if you compare Hillary Clinton&#39;s score card for accuracy against Donald Trump&#39;s score card for accuracy in fact-checking, they look nothing like each other.
