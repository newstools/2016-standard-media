Kenyans should elect well-educated leaders to represent them. North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood has urged voters to consider electing professionals who have attained at least a degree to the National Assembly and diploma holders at county assembly level. Residents should realise delivery of services is anchored on the level of education one has,&rdquo; he said. Dawood attained his master&rsquo;s in Business Administration at the Kenya Methodist University. He observed that the level of debate in the Houses had been adversely affected by the low education of some members. &ldquo;There are law makers who seldom contribute to crucial debates because they are unable to articulate issues,&rdquo; Dawood added.
