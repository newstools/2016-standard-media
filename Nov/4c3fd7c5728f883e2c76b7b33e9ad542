The situation in South Sudan remains fluid. But while the United States of America favours sanctions against the main antagonists; President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar, Russia believes doing so would set back gains made towards peaceful negotiations. These opposed stands do not help the situation. What began as political differences between the two leaders has unfortunately taken on an ethnic dimension, pitting the Nuer and Dinka sub-tribes against each other. The South Sudan war has to date claimed more than 10,000 lives, displaced more than 2 million citizens and precipitated a humanitarian crisis that has seen at least 4.8 million people depend on food, shelter and other humanitarian assistance from the United Nations. Previous peace efforts undertaken by regional powers under the auspices of the African Union and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the latest of which was signed in April 2016, have failed to guarantee peace in South Sudan. This calls for tougher measures that include an arms embargo on South Sudan and travel restrictions on Kiir, Machar and the army generals who orchestrate the war in Africa&rsquo;s youngest nation.There is danger of the South Sudan war degenerating into genocide. Tough measures should therefore be taken to avoid this happening. South Sudanese citizens deserve better.
