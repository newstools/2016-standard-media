A court has ordered four Chinese nationals and a Ugandan deported within 10 days for being in Kenya illegally.Rong Bing, Wang Dongxu, Zhu Webbing and Su Pinghu also faced further charges of operating a gambling business illegally.They were arrested on Monday after a tip from members of the public, and are believed to be behind the gambling machines that flooded the streets of Kisumu. During the raid, officers confiscated 136 gambling machines and two vehicles with Ugandan registration plates from two residences in Milimani estate.They also found equipment used to assemble the machines.During the hearing on Tuesday, the case was delayed for several hours for lack of a Chinese interpreter.The court heard that the four worked for a Chinese company but were in the country on tourist visas. They were also found guilty of working without a work permit.Resident Magistrate Martha Agutu ordered the five to pay a fine of Sh50,000 or face three months in jail.Their conviction comes barely a week after five other Chinese nationals were arrested and fined on similar charges.Last week, Kisumu MCAs voted unanimously to impose a ban on Chinese gambling machines.
