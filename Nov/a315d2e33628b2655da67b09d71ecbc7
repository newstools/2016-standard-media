The governorship race in Kiambu County is getting hotter by the day as more aspirants join the fray. With only 10 months left to the August 8 polls, James Nyoro has thrown his hat into the ring. Dr Nyoro, who also vied for the position in the 2013 elections on a Narc party ticket but lost to the incumbent William Kabogo, said he would be seeking the seat on a Jubilee Party ticket. During the 2013 elections, he was second after garnering 241,658 votes against Kabogo&#39;s 487,631. Speaking at Nyathuna PCEA Church in Kabete Constituency on Sunday, Nyoro said his dream to see a developed Kiambu was still valid and called on residents to support his candidature. &quot;When we look at Kiambu, we realise nothing much has been achieved. This is the time to redeem Kiambu&#39;s lost glory. The county has over time been ranked poorly in terms of development compared to others which I will ensure is not the case,&quot; he promised.

He believes 60 per cent of residents depend on agriculture for livelihood. He said his experience and expertise as an adviser on agriculture and food security to the presidents of Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia will come in handy to ensure the county becomes a role model in agribusiness. &quot;By reviving agriculture, we will help in improving a majority of the residents&#39; livelihoods by creating employment for the many jobless youth,&quot; he said. He vowed to ensure he raised investor confidence to make the county an industrial hub. Nyoro will battle it out for the coveted Jubilee Party ticket with his political nemesis Kabogo. He will also be facing Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu and David Kariuki Ngari, a real estate mogul commonly known as Gakuyo.
