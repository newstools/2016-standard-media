The bitter exchanges between the Government and the Opposition over the war on graft continued yesterday, as Deputy President William Ruto accused CORD leader Raila Odinga of double standards in the matter. Speaking at Chuka Catholic Church, Tharaka Nithi County, Ruto accused Raila of defending corruption allegations in Kilifi County. The DP claimed CORD leaders are quick to fault Jubilee in the war on corruption because they benefit from the vice in some of the counties led by its governors. &quot;Raila is passionate about the fight against graft in Jubilee administration, while he is condoning corruption in ODM-led counties. If you squander public funds, don&#39;t expect the party or your tribe to defend you, a thief is a thief,&quot; he said. Ruto asked the ODM leader to come clean and explain when the debts incurred to Mumias Sugar Company by a company associated with him will be paid. &quot;Let him explain to residents of Kakamega the corruption that brought Mumias to its knees, which he knows and he and his colleagues are beneficiaries. When are they going to step forward so that they can account for the losses?&quot; he asked.
