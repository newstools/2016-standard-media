The integrity, character and qualifications of individuals named to serve as board members of public and private companies will become considerations if a proposed law is passed into law. The import of Ugenya MP David Ochieng&rsquo;s Bill is that if it is enacted, corrupt and incompetent persons will be barred from serving as board directors. It has been determined that the presence of such unsavoury individuals has fueled corruption, incompetence and led to the collapse of some important organisations. Livelihoods have been destroyed and jobs lost due to the poor conduct of such board members. The Bill proposes that a disciplinary committee be set up with the mandate to issue letters of admonishment, suspend the certificate of a member, withdraw or cancel a certificate, impose fines or remove a member from the directors&rsquo; register. The proposed law will require that board directors meet standards set by the Institute of Directors Kenya (IoDK). Rogue board members will be held personally liable for their decisions during their tenure. It is envisaged that this will help curb corruption and professionalise the running of State corporations, which have been mismanaged and plundered with increasing frequency. We encourage stakeholders to see that this Bill passed into law. READ MORE Rampant graft reflects lack of values, integrity
