Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i has supported the decision to ban the supply of food to exam candidates in schools.The ban was announced by Coast Regional Co-ordinator Nelson Marwa.Dr Matiang&#39;i said the ministry would not entertain such acts and those who willing to support Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exam students should instead go through the sub-county directors of education and sub-county commissioners. &quot;Mr Marwa was right and we are not going to allow this as a ministry. I can tell you, and this is for sure, that those pretending to donate food to schools do not have the interests of students at heart. They only want to achieve political ends,&quot; he said.National functionThe CS said primary and secondary school education was a national function, not a county affair and as such, it was wrong of politicians to use their portraits while giving out food to students.&quot;If all of us go to our schools and campaign there, print T-shirts in all our colours and print everything with our portraits, what type of society would we be living in? Isn&#39;t it common sense that we just cannot do that?&quot;The food programme from politicians has nothing to do with the children. It is pure petty politics,&quot; he said.
