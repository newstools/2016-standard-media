Anxiety over the membership of Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s &nbsp;presidential campaign team announced yesterday,&nbsp;and the failure by the party leadership to unveil&nbsp;national Jubilee Party (JP) officials have triggered&nbsp;fresh turmoil within the party.During a Special National Governing Council&nbsp;meeting at Bomas of Kenya attended by the President&nbsp;and Deputy President William Ruto yesterday,&nbsp;some delegates protested after the list of the Jubilee&rsquo;s&nbsp;Presidential Campaign Committee was read out&nbsp;by the DP. At one point, DP Ruto was forced to interrupt his&nbsp;speech as groups of people streamed towards the&nbsp;dais where the President was sitting, to submit additional&nbsp;names. Amid the protestations, Ruto told&nbsp;delegates to submit proposals where they felt names&nbsp;had been left out.&nbsp;The delegates were expecting that the governing&nbsp;council would table a list of an expanded team of interim&nbsp;national party officials.Anxiety over a list of members of&nbsp;Jubilee&rsquo;s Presidential Campaign&nbsp;Committee announced yesterday,&nbsp;and the failure by President Uhuru&nbsp;Kenyatta and Deputy President William&nbsp;Ruto to unveil national Jubilee&nbsp;Party (JP) officials has triggered fresh&nbsp;turmoil within the party.During a meeting at Bomas of Kenya&nbsp;attended by the President and&nbsp;DP Ruto yesterday, some delegates&nbsp;protested after the list of the campaign&nbsp;committee was read out by the&nbsp;DP.At one point, Ruto was forced to&nbsp;interrupt his speech as groups of&nbsp;people streamed towards the dais&nbsp;where the President was sitting, to&nbsp;submit additional names. Amid the&nbsp;protests, Ruto told delegates to submit&nbsp;proposals where they felt names&nbsp;had been left out.It had been widely expected that&nbsp;naming of the officials would be central&nbsp;to JP&rsquo;s first special National Governing Council meeting at Bomas &nbsp;yesterday. Instead, Ruto announced&nbsp;that the party would only hold elections&nbsp;for its officials 90 days after&nbsp;next year&rsquo;s General Election. The&nbsp;party elections, he said, would be&nbsp;presided over by the Independent&nbsp;Electoral and Boundaries Commission&nbsp;(IEBC).&nbsp;Yesterday, President Kenyatta and&nbsp;the DP walked into the Bomas auditorium&nbsp;a few minutes to 1pm armed&nbsp;with a 61-member list, largely populated sitting legislators, and called&nbsp;it Jubilee&rsquo;s Presidential Campaign&nbsp;Committee.Crucial boost&nbsp;Some of the members of the campaign&nbsp;committee have been working&nbsp;closely with Jubilee leadership on&nbsp;various fronts. For instance, Kiraitu&nbsp;Murungi co-chaired the committee&nbsp;that spearheaded dissolution of various&nbsp;parties into Jubilee. Former legislator&nbsp;Raphael Tuju has been working&nbsp;as an advisor to the President and&nbsp;has been mentioned as the likely&nbsp;candidate for the position of JP&rsquo;s secretary&nbsp;general. Naomi Shaaban and&nbsp;Katoo ole Metito have been President&nbsp;Kenyatta&rsquo;s close allies over time.At least four members of the campaign&nbsp;committee have declared interest&nbsp;in the gubernatorial position&nbsp;in Nairobi. They Include Mike Sonko,&nbsp;ohnson Sakaja, Bishop Margaret&nbsp;Wanjiru and Dennis Waweru. Nairobi&nbsp;is the only county that has seen&nbsp;four gubernatorial candidates&nbsp;named in the presidential campaign&nbsp;committee.Yesterday, delegates had been expecting&nbsp;that the governing council&nbsp;would name party officials to replace&nbsp;the interim officials.&nbsp;Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria&nbsp;had intimated that naming of party&nbsp;officials would be a crucial boost in setting the political ball rolling. Kuria&nbsp;had exuded confidence that the inauguration&nbsp;of officials would go a&nbsp;long way towards ensuring a majority&nbsp;win for JP in next year&rsquo;s General&nbsp;Election.&ldquo;We will hit the ground running&nbsp;with maximum force. Let them&nbsp;watch this space. Seventy per cent&nbsp;plus one is a &nbsp;reality,&rdquo; said Kuria.When The Standard on Saturday&nbsp;contacted him yesterday, he received&nbsp;the call but became jittery when we&nbsp;introduced the topic. He said he was&nbsp;in traffic and would call back but he&nbsp;hadn&rsquo;t by the time of going to press.Laikipia West MP Wachira Karani&nbsp;said the unveiling of interim party&nbsp;officials would have given proper direction&nbsp;to a vigorous campaign and&nbsp;recruitment of members.While some legislators openly rejected &nbsp;the list, others could be heard&nbsp;registering their discomfort to each&nbsp;other in whispers moments after DP&nbsp;Ruto finished reading out the list.&nbsp;Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki noted&nbsp;that the presidential campaign committee&nbsp;unveiled yesterday was a disservice&nbsp;to aspirants who fear those&nbsp;picked were endorsed by the President&nbsp;and his deputy.&ldquo;The feelings of the aspirants to&nbsp;have a non-partisan team are legitimate&nbsp;and their issue has not been&nbsp;sorted. Most of those picked are politicians&nbsp;with vested interests and&nbsp;they may use their positions to scare&nbsp;off opponents,&rdquo; said Mbiuki.The Standard on Saturday spoke&nbsp;to highly-placed sources within the&nbsp;party, who intimated that a decision&nbsp;to name a new list of Jubilee Party interim&nbsp;officials was withdrawn at the&nbsp;last minute for fear of possible fallout.&nbsp;Development record&nbsp; &ldquo;We all knew that the list of officials&nbsp;was to be officially released today&nbsp;(yesterday). Even key players in&nbsp;the party had been informed. But&nbsp;there was an early morning meeting&nbsp;between President Kenyatta and DP&nbsp;Ruto at State House after which the&nbsp;list of officials was withdrawn from&nbsp;yesterday&rsquo;s agenda. There was conventional&nbsp;opinion that the forum&nbsp;would not be the best platform to&nbsp;unveil the list,&rdquo; said our source.Prior to the announcement of the&nbsp;campaign committee, it was all jubilations&nbsp;for President Kenyatta as he&nbsp;addressed the delegates. His speech&nbsp;was interrupted by several standing&nbsp;ovations from the crowd that kept&nbsp;shouting,&nbsp;&ldquo;Uhuru Kiboko Yao&rdquo; as he&nbsp;poked holes into former Prime Minister&nbsp;Raila Odinga&rsquo;s candidacy.The President&rsquo;s pattern of speech&nbsp;assumed three dimensions &mdash; he vigorously&nbsp;enumerated his development&nbsp;record, launched an all-out&nbsp;war against Raila and pleaded with&nbsp;the delegates to popularise the party&nbsp;in preparation for his re-election bid.Kenyatta listed what he said is Jubilee&rsquo;s major achievements, ranging&nbsp;from education, security, energy and&nbsp;water and transport industry among&nbsp;others.He described Raila as a leader who thrives on &ldquo;propaganda, lies,&nbsp;and rumours&rdquo;. At one point, he referred&nbsp;to Raila as &ldquo;Lord of Poverty&rdquo;.&ldquo;We refuse to be distracted by people who want to divert our attention&nbsp;from doing the best for Kenyans&nbsp;into a dirty field of dirty things. A&nbsp;man who cannot compete on the basis&nbsp;of ideology, one who thrives on&nbsp;propaganda is not worth our attention.Every project we start he calls it&nbsp;ufisadi (graft). He has lied about a&nbsp;water project in Murang&rsquo;a, he is today&nbsp;lying about another one in Kipsigis&nbsp;in the hope that we shall lose&nbsp;votes. All the projects we do, he can&rsquo;t&nbsp;see. No wonder he is called Lord of&nbsp;Poverty,&rdquo; Kenyatta said.DP Ruto equally tore into the op-position leadership, saying they are&nbsp;incapable of leading the country to&nbsp;prosperity. &ldquo;If you combine the number of&nbsp;years you and I were ministers, it is&nbsp;seven years. If you compare that with&nbsp;the number of years our competitors&nbsp;served as ministers in total, Kalonzo&nbsp;almost 30, Raila&rsquo;s 30, Musalia&rsquo;s almost&nbsp;30 and the rest... you will discover&nbsp;that they were actually in Cabinet&nbsp;for 105 years. Yet we have been&nbsp;able to do more in three years than &nbsp;what these people did for the 105&nbsp;years they were in Cabinet. What is it now that they want to do differently?&rdquo;&nbsp;said Ruto amid laughter from&nbsp;delegates.
