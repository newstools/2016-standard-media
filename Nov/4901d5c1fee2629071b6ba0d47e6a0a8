SYDNEY:&nbsp;Australian officials have met with the three Crown Resorts Ltd employees detained in China since mid-October, Australia&#39;s foreign minister Julie Bishop said, after the trio were formally arrested on suspicion of gambling offences. Australian officials visited their three nationals - part of a larger group of 17 Crown employees in detention - in Shanghai, Bishop told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. &quot;We were able to provide advice and support. We provided messages from their families. There is an anti-corruption agenda of President Xi Jinping and gambling is one of the areas of interest, so we are subject to the laws of China.&quot; The consular visit comes a day after Australian authorities confirmed that three nationals, including Crown&#39;s head of international VIP gambling, Jason O&#39;Connor, were arrested. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed the three had been arrested on suspicion of gambling offences. &quot;China will continue to handle this case in accordance with the law,&quot; he told reporters in Beijing, without elaborating.

The fate of the other 14 is not clear. Crown did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The detention of the Crown employees has sparked concern about a wider crackdown on gambling in China. Analysts have linked the detentions - which sent Crown&#39;s shares tumbling - to Chinese laws banning casinos from advertising or promoting gambling in the Chinese mainland, for instance by offering credit to high-spending clients. In October, Crown said &quot;less than half&quot; its international VIP revenue, or about 12 percent of total revenue, came from Chinese high-rollers.
