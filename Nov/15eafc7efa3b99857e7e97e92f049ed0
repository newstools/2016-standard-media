MCAs have finally passed the 2016/17 budget, ending a five-month standoff with Governor Nderitu Gachagua. This is the second time MCAs passed a budget this year. The first budget was passed on June 30 but was rejected by Mr Gachagua, leading to a standoff that almost brought county operations to a standstill. After months of closed-door negotiations, both sides finally struck a compromise, albeit with a few adjustments. The MCAs refused to reinstate Sh13million to buy new vehicles for Gachagua. His Sh10million allocation for technical services was also rejected.
