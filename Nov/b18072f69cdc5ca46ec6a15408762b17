Washington D.C.: On his way to the polls on election day, Michael Flynn pulled out his phone and took a video of himself saying his vote for Donald Trump was part of a larger fight against &quot;the dishonesty and deceit of our government.&quot; For Flynn, a retired U.S. Army three-star general and one of Trump&#39;s closest advisers, it was another parting shot at an administration he thinks unfairly fired him from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2014 for telling hard truths about the war on Islamist extremism. Named on Thursday to become Trump&#39;s national security adviser, Flynn is now poised for a second act in public life &ndash; and he has promised nothing short of an upheaval. &quot;We just went through a revolution,&quot; Flynn, 57, told a forum on Saturday. &quot;This is probably the biggest election in our nation&#39;s history, since bringing on George Washington when he decided not to be a king. That&#39;s how important this is.&quot; Flynn&#39;s advocates say his experience battling radical Islamist militants in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with candor that has ruffled feathers in Washington more than once, makes him the kind of ally Trump needs on his national security team. David Deptula, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who used to work with Flynn, praised his willingness to &quot;speak truth to power and not politicize his answers.&quot; READ MORE Trump may discuss U.S. secretary of state job with critic Romney: source Enter Trump and real trouble beckons Trump touts foreign contacts on Twitter to ward off critics &quot;Mike Flynn is a straight shooter and a no-bullshit kind of guy. And that&rsquo;s exactly what we need in terms of senior leaders giving advice to the national leadership,&quot; Deptula said. His critics voice concerns about a management style that alienated some of his subordinates at DIA, a lumbering bureaucracy that Flynn sought to shake up. That&#39;s an explanation some gave for why he was pushed into retirement. Flynn could not be reached for comment. Several former U.S. officials who worked closely with Flynn described him as extremely smart but a poor manager who advocated a precipitous overhaul of the DIA that ignited hostility and resistance from veteran intelligence officials. &quot;Flynn understood that DIA was a mess,&quot; one said. &quot;But he telegraphed his intent for radical change in a way that he immediately created resistance to his ideas, no matter their merits.&quot; Two other former officials also said they had concerns about Flynn&#39;s management style, a potential liability in a White House job that requires coordinating U.S. policy and resolving disagreements among senior officials at different agencies.
