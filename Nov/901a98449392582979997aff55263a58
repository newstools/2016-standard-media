&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} Seoul:South Korea&#39;s presidential office on Wednesday named a new prime minister and finance minister, the highest-level shake-up since President Park Geun-hye&#39;s administration was rocked by a scandal involving a friend accused of meddling in state affairs. But opposition parties denounced the reshuffle as a bid by Park to divert attention from the political crisis, which has dragged her approval rating to an all-time low. The Blue House named Financial Services Commission Chairman Yim Jong-yong as finance minister and deputy prime minister. Yim, who replaces incumbent minister Yoo Il-ho, has been well-regarded by policy-makers and market participants in his current role. Kim Byong-joon, a senior presidential secretary during former president Roh Moo-hyun&#39;s administration, is expected to replace Hwang Kyo-ahn as prime minister. The prime minister&#39;s role in South Korea is largely administrative and requires parliamentary approval. Kim initially scheduled a news conference but later called it off, saying he would speak further on Thursday.

Appointing Kim, who has a reputation as a liberal, appears to be a bid by the conservative Park to placate the opposition and soothe public anger over the scandal involving Park&#39;s friend, Choi Soon-sil, who is in custody and under investigation by prosecutors. But the shake-up, which included a new minister of public safety and security, did little to please the opposition. &quot;This replacement of the prime minister and finance minister can&#39;t be happening without discussing it with the opposition,&quot; Park Jie-won, leader of the opposition People&#39;s Party, told a party meeting. &quot;We won&#39;t stand by such a move to turn around the current situation with the personnel change,&quot; said Park, adding that his party would boycott nomination hearings. South Korean stocks and the won currency did not react to the cabinet changes. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
