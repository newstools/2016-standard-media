Some 21,095 primary school pupils will have their two-month holiday cut short to take part in a study aimed at improving the quality of the subject. The Ministry of Education wants Standard Two pupils in 300 public primary schools across the country recalled to take part in the study between November 28 and 30. The schools have been sampled from all the 47 counties. Education Permanent Secretary Belio Kipsang said the children will participate in the three-day baseline survey aimed at improving early grade mathematics.
