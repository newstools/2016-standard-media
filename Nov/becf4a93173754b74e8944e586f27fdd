Experts in the building industry will convene at the Strathmore Business School tomorrow as part of the initial training in becoming green building accredited professionals.The Green Star Existing Buildings Accredited Professional training is targeted at experts from different disciplines, including architects, quantity surveyors, project managers, sustainable property developers, students and lecturers. The group will be taken through a whole day workshop with the aim of understanding the importance of sustainability in the built environment, fully comprehend the existing buildings performance tool and ultimately become an green star rating experts.Accreditation&ldquo;The accreditation is very important for individuals who attain it because as a registered and accredited professional, one will be able to guide a project team in the implementation of green initiatives and the ultimate certification of a project as sustainability compliant,&rdquo; says Elizabeth Chege, the chairperson of the Kenya Green Building Society.To become a fully accredited professional through this programme, one must complete three steps, namely face-to-face workshop, complete an online course, and go through an online exam.&ldquo;This three-part programme provides a comprehensive overview of the green star rating system. It includes the rating of the environmental performance of the design and construction of buildings, including major refurbishments. It provides insights into all major aspects of environmental sustainability that should be considered in the design and construction of green buildings,&rdquo; says Chege.Apart from rating the professionals, the training will also help guide in the manufacture and selection of materials used in buildings to ensure they conform to green building parameters. These include paints, cement, steel, carpets, insulation, timber, furniture, water fixtures, sealants, and electrical equipment.Despite having the natural resources required to create sustainable structures, Kenya still lags behind in the construction of green buildings, opting to copy the glass clad edifices of the West that are not compatible with local climatic conditions.
