ELDORET: There is growing disquiet in the North Rift over the Jubilee Presidential Campaign team following the omission of representatives&nbsp;from the region.From the list, representations from the regions such as Uasin Gishu, Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet Counties is conspicuously missing despite being a Jubilee&#39;s stronghold and the backyard of Deputy President William Ruto. Locals are alleging foul play and now want a review of the list in order to include the youth and a representation from every region.They have also castigated the local leadership for failing to raise the issue over perceived fear of crossing lines with the DP by being seen to be against his decision.President Kenyatta and his Deputy unveiled the national campaign team during the party&#39;s first National Governing Council at Bomas last weekend with optimism that the group selected from the eight previous provinces will ensure him a win in the coming polls.In the Rift, the members comprise of National assembly deputy speaker Joyce Laboso from Bomet and Narok, Turkana and Trans Nzoia Women representatives Soipan Tuya, Joyce Emanikor and Janet Nangabo respectively.Others are West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin, Kajiado MP Katoo Ole Metito, Turkana Senator John Munyes, Nakuru Speaker Susan Kihika and Davis Sankok from Narok.North Rift Jubilee youth leader Kiprotich Cherargei accused the ruling government of failing to ensure that there is a fair representation of the party campaigners.&quot;We expected the likes of Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and our Nandi Senator Stephen Sang to feature in the list because they have been vocal in selling the party&#39;s policies, what was agreed upon is not ideal and we feel let down,&quot; he said.Cherargei pointed out that no youth was considered unlike the 2013 general elections that propelled the two principals to power where the team strategized thus locking out the opposition. He further insisted that due to the vastness of the North Rift region, it will be an uphill task for those selected to spearhead campaigns in 2017.&quot;How do you expect Senator Munyes and Women Representative to singlehandedly traverse the North Rift seeking for votes yet there are dedicated people such as the youths who can comfortably play a role,&quot; he posed.Many pundits opine that the omission of the likes of Mandago is brought up by the likely fear by the top party officials allied to the DP in bestowing them with an opportunity that might give them an advantage against their opponents during the nominations.Aspirants allied to Jubilee have also cast doubt over the list and the manner in which elected leaders have been given a chance to spearhead the campaigns in 2017.They insist that such slots would have been awarded to fresh individuals not holding positions in government so that no intimidation or preference should be witnessed in the polls.&quot;The list is not inclusive and also a reward to cronies when we need new blood, our worry is on the presumed conflict of interest by elected leaders spearheading the campaigns and strategy, what happens to those aspirants who may be seeking to unseat them, are they not going to be intimidated?,&quot; posed Geoffrey Chebwai who has expressed interest for a Uasin Gishu senatorial seat.He noted that no consultations with stakeholders took place and there is need for a review before the next polls in order to bring an end to the uneasiness in the region perceived to be Jubilee stronghold.Kalenjin Council of Elders maintain they are anticipating a meeting with the DP to deliberate on pertinent issues pertaining the party.The group Chair emeritus (rtd) Major John Seii they have been in touch with Ruto and looking forward an avenue where they can talk on plans for the party before 2017.Phillip Chebunet, a lecturer and chairman of the Department of Communication studies at the University of Eldoret (UoE) said the current contention is pegged on rush by the party to address calls by its supporters to have officials in place before December.The lecturer who also doubles up as a political analyst said the party should have conducted grassroots election to select officials who will drum up support for Kenyatta and Ruto.&quot;Bringing old guard to lead in the campaigns is a move that has not gone well with the youth and it will be costly for the party if they do not rectify it,&quot; said Chebunet.Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen defended the party leaders&rsquo; decision saying that every supporter has a role in ensuring a win for Jubilee administration.He also hinted that there is another list of officials that was not disclosed to the public and locals should be content that government is working towards its re-election.&quot;There are many leaders behind the scene that is working in realizing the party&#39;s agenda, which is why my name was not included in the list unveiled by the president. Responsibility should not necessarily be based on visibility,&quot; he maintained.Murkomen noted that the DP among other leaders represents the North Rift and will team up to drum up support for the political vehicle.Even as a number raised concerns, supporters of JP in Trans Nzoia have lauded the inclusion of Janet Nangabo into the campaign team.Led by Scolastica Wanyama, the supporters described Mrs. Nangabo as a steadfast and influential leader in the county and able to marshal support for JAP.&quot;We are happy that they picked Nangabo to coordinator campaigns in the county. She is the right leader and we will support her to secure votes for the party in the area,&quot; said Wanyama.Kalenjin and Kikuyu elders in Trans-Nzoia County also backed the MP saying the government has entrusted their leader in reaping votes from the cosmopolitan area currently dominated by Ford Kenya party.
