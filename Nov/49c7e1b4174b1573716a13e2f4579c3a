BUNGOMA, KENYA: Bungoma is set to attract massive investments following the launch of one its crucial roads. The Misikhu-Naitiri-Brigadier road, which is 40 kilometres long, connects Bungoma to Kakamega and by extension Uasin Gishu and Trans-Nzoia counties. Within Bungoma, the stretch runs through two, agriculturally-rich sub-counties: Webuye East and Kakamega. &quot;The tarmacking of this road opens up the surrounding areas for many opportunities. Farmers will be able to transport their produces to the market fast,&quot; said Governor Ken Lusaka. The Governor says the tarmacking of the road is &quot;part of the fulfillment of the grand plans my government has had for the people of Bungoma. We expect to tarmac more roads in the county, creating a more conducive environment for businesses.&quot; The work on the road, which in total will cost Sh1.1 billion, would involve tarmacking, construction of four bridges and culverts at all entry or access points.
