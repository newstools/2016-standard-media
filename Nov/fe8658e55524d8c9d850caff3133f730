The Jubilee government has revealed plans to construct Sh50 billion key road to link Makueni and Kitui counties. The 420km road will be constructed in three phases. The first phase begins in Kibwezi through Kitui to Mutomo. The second phase is from Kitui via Mwingi to Kandwia, while the last phase stretches from Kandwia through Tseikuru to Usueni. The road will eventually be linked to the Garrissa-Moyale corridor. Speaking yesterday during a media briefing, Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich said the project to be funded by China-Exim Bank will be launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta next Tuesday in Kitui. Leaders from Ukambani region who attended the briefing included MPs Joe Mutambo (Mwingi Central) and Rachel Nyamai (Kitui South).

Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Liu Xianfa said he was glad&nbsp;six-month negotiations between his office and the Treasury had been fruitful. &quot;Over the last 50 years, China has pumped Sh540 billion into Kenyan infrastructural projects, and I believe that this amount makes China the largest bilateral donor for Kenya,&quot; Dr Liu said.
