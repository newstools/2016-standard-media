The national government has embarked on modernising Eldoret-based Rivatex to increase the production of textile products and attract the global export market. Industry and Enterprise Development&nbsp;Principal Secretary Julius Korir said the focus was to ensure that the local textile industry competes with other countries. &quot;We expect to increase our production by enhancing the modernisation of Rivatex for local and export markets. Our goal is to reach the US textile market by 2025,&quot; said Mr Korir. Early this year,&nbsp;Rivatex received a Sh3 billion loan from India&#39;s Exim Bank to revive the industry and purchase a modern textile machine. Korir, who led other seven principal secretaries from other line State departments on a tour of the Rivatex plant in Eldoret on Saturday, said their target was 1 billion textile products.

However, cotton products had declined drastically to less than 20,0000 bales annually. The PS said Rivatex would partner with Kerio Valley Development Authority to promote cotton growing in the Kerio Valley belt. He said other areas targeted for cotton growing include Western and Nyanza regions. He said the increased production at Rivatex would supply Export Processing Zone factories, adding that Sh50 million had been pumped into reviving the Kicomi textile sector at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University. The money will be used to promote the running of the textile mill so that it becomes a centre for training and expose people to modern production methods. &quot;We want to use our local industries to create job opportunities for our youths. Our goal is to also create 300 to 400 industrial jobs. We are focusing on sectors with a high labour content,&quot; he said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
