Four people including three university students were arrested on Wednesday for conducting an illegal tuition session at a church compound in Kikuyu Town, Kiambu County. The four include the caretaker manning the PCEA Church in Kikuyu and three students from University of Nairobi. Police who were accompanied by education officials raided the premise and ordered the students to go home before arresting the four. This followed a tip that there were tuition sessions going on in rooms at the compound. Police say the four will appear in court tomorrow to face charges. Tuition is banned under the new Education Act. Already the ministry of education has cancelled the license of Happyland School in Buruburu for conducting illegal tuition and arrested the head teacher.
