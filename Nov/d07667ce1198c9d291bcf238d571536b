More than a quarter of British women are regularly skipping breakfast in a bid to lose weight, according to a new study.Millions of women are opting for the unhealthy tactic in a bid to cut calories according to a new report into the nation&rsquo;s eating habits.But according to the survey the average female that opts to skip meals actually ends up eating more than they should. A staggering four in ten women say they skip meal-times in order to try and eat less and four in ten skip breakfast to try and cut daily calories down.A quarter regularly miss lunch and one in ten frequently don&rsquo;t bother with an evening meal.[PHOTO: COURTESY]But according to the data, the average female ends up eating more than they should do by skipping meals &ndash; with women completely losing track of what they have eaten at least two days in a typical week.In fact, eight in ten said they end up eating more as they become so hungry after missing a meal &ndash; with the average number of times women eat in a day now emerging as six times.Picking at food while preparing the family evening meal or eating left-overs from the children&rsquo;s plates surfaced as a main form of &ldquo;unconscious eating&rdquo; according to the report.Nearly two thirds (64 percent) admitted they are unaware of what they are putting into their bodies, grabbing whatever food is available from vending machines and shops.A further one in five even admit they resort to fast food from drive-thru restaurants in order to just &lsquo;get something down them.&rsquo;A whopping 44 percent claimed to be far too busy to plan healthy, regular meals - and half said they kid themselves about the number of calories they consume most days.Nutritionist Karen Poole who was involved in the study said &ldquo;The rise in popularity of grazing is becoming more commonplace for British women and actually resembles more closely how we once ate as hunters and gatherers.&ldquo;In fact, a larger number of smaller meals throughout the day can be a great way to keep the metabolism ticking over and maintains a healthy diet.&ldquo;However the foods we snack on are key to making this kind of diet a suitable and healthy way of life &ndash; and the results of this study show many women aren&rsquo;t making wise choices.&rdquo;A spokesman for Planters Nuts who commissioned the study said &ldquo;Busy and unpredictable lives mean women are reaching for food as and when it&rsquo;s convenient.&ldquo;Whilst we may start out with good intentions, things get in the way and sitting at the table for the conventional three meals a day is sometimes unrealistic.&quot;
