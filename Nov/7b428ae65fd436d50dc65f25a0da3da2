Some 2,500 tea farmers are yet to get their annual bonus payment a week after a State agency released the money.The farmers have been camping at the cash strapped Sot Tea Growers Sacco (Stegro) for days with empty promises from the management.The payment is supposed to be made through the sacco based in Silibwet trading centre. The farmers, expecting more than Sh80 million, have now called on the Government for intervention citing mismanagement at the sacco, which has been struggling to stay afloat for the last two years.&ldquo;We are not taking lightly the excuses the sacco management is giving, because these are the same lame excuses we got and we lost more than Sh64 million during bonus last year,&rdquo; Vincent Lang&rsquo;at, an affected farmer said.Threatening to stage a demonstration to demand action, the farmers have accused the Government of allowing the society to continue operating despite its questionable liquidity.Mr Lang&rsquo;at said besides the unpaid bonus, savings of more than 12,000 members cannot be released by the society.&ldquo;The Sacco can no longer manage to release members savings due to financial challenges arising from poor management,&rdquo; he said.PLACED INJUNCTION&ldquo;We wonder how it has been able to operate its front-office arm,&rdquo; said Langat, blaming the Government for failing to take action.However, the sacco&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer Julius Yegon defended the delay, saying it was not due to lack of money at the society.Mr Yegon said the delay had been occasioned by ousted officials who had gone to court.&ldquo;We have a problem accessing the money because the previous officials who have since been voted out placed an injunction to protest against their removal from office,&rdquo; he said.He said all was not lost as they had sought a court order to be allowed to pay the farmers, adding that the money will be paid out this week.&ldquo;I can assure our members that their money is there and they will get it before the end of the week.&ldquo;We have received Sh81 million from the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) in bonus for the members and we will release all of it,&rdquo; said the officer.The sacco is also struggling to service a loan it took from Cooperative Bank to build a private factory at Merigi in Bomet East.Mr Yegon said the society had reached an agreement with the bank to reschedule the loan for a year to enable them complete a recovery plan.He expressed optimism the recovery plan would see the sacco secure a Sh170 million from Embomos Tea Farm in shares of the factory that was yet to be completed.He said more money will be released by the county government to enable them complete the factory and pay members Sh64 million as bonus areas for 2015.
