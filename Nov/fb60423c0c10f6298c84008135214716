Tanzanian authorities said on Friday they are investigating reports that three wildlife officials have got away with poaching of animals for bush meat in Mbeya region in December last year. &ldquo;We have launched investigations following the reports. Anyone that will be implicated will have to face the music,&rdquo; said Gaudence Milanzi, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. Milanzi said if the country were not careful about its animals they (animals) would be depleted. &ldquo;Thank God that in some areas such as the Selous Game Reserve the situation is stabilising but this should not be reason to relax,&rdquo; said Milanzi. The reports said two wildlife officers and a tourism officer with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism colluded with suspected poachers in December last year and killed nine animals adjacent to Inyonga South hunting block in Chunya district, Mbeya region. The reports said they killed the nine animals, including one hartebeest, one sable antelope, one roan antelope, three warthogs and three reedbucks. The sources said the suspects were reported to police and they were later charged in court with economic sabotage case number 18/2015 where they were released on bail.&nbsp; READ MORE Mombasa to host global tourism forum Police seize 12 tonnes of sandalwood in Samburu, Kenya Kenya wins bid to host world tourism congress
