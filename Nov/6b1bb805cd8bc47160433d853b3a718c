A company has sued former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo for failing to settle a Sh42 million debt.Emris Investment Ltd sued Mr Jirongo and his company, Kuza Farm and Allied Limited, amid reports that the former legislator was set to receive Sh250 million from the Nairobi City County government for two acres on which a public primary school stands. &ldquo;Since judgement was entered against him to pay the debt, he has been issuing bouncing cheques and failed to settle the amount. We have information that the Nairobi City County is going to pay him a substantial amount. We want part of it to settle our debt,&rdquo; said lawyer Mutembei Marete.Sale agreementThe dispute dates back to 2008, when Jirongo entered into a land sale agreement with Emris Investment Ltd. Jirongo was meant to sell land in Imara Daima estate, Nairobi, to Emris.The firm paid a deposit of Sh12 million but the sale agreement did not go through as the land was sold to a third party without their knowledge.Emris sued Jirongo in 2013 for compensation and the court ordered him to pay Sh32 million plus interest, bringing the total amount to Sh42 million.&ldquo;He has only paid Sh2 million since the judgement was entered. Despite constant reminders, he has failed to pay up and issued five bouncing cheques,&rdquo; said Mr Marete.Lady Justice Mary Gitumbi will give directions on the case on Friday.
