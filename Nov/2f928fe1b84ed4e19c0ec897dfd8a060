Six Mandera MPs have vowed to defy a directive by their clan elders blocking them from the 2017 General Election. The resolution by the Garre Council of Elders in August this year introduced a model of rotational leadership that blocks sub-clans within the community from holding one political seat for more than a single term. This will bolster the position of Governor Ali Roba in the leadership row pitting him against the elders. Roba has expressed his frustration with the model of rotational leadership and vowed to defy it. MPs Mohamud Mohammed (Mandera West), Mohammed Haji (Banisa), Aden Mohamed Noor (Mandera North) and Mohamed Adan Huka (Mandera South) have today supported Roba and asked the electorate in the region not to abide by the elders&#39; ruling. Of the six, only Mohamud had been given the go-ahead to run for the senatorial seat to replace Senator Billow Kerrow, who has promised to abide by the elders&#39; resolution.
