It also occurs more commonly among the Luo, both groups coming from the malaria zones of the lake region.&ldquo;It is surprising to find that Luo and Luhya children resident in Nairobi retain such high risks of this cancer; characteristic of their home area,&rdquo; says the study.&shy;The cancer, which has been linked to endemic malaria exposure, is hardly significant in other ethnic groups in Nairobi.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious that cancer patterns described many years ago in different tribes and regions of Kenya seem to persist in the modern urban population,&rdquo; says Mrs Korir.&shy;The study published in the International Journal of Cancer was carried out at the Nairobi Cancer Registry and targeted only residents of Nairobi going out of its way to exclude referral cases.&shy;The staff of Nairobi Cancer Registry visited all health facilities in the city involved in the diagnosis and management of cancer patients for registration. Death certificates of cancer patients who died in Nairobi were also used to identify cases.&shy;The main tribes included in this study were Kikuyu, Kamba, Kisii, Kalenjin, Luo, Luhya, Somalis, Asians, non-Kenyans, whites, other tribes and a group classified as unknown.Mrs Korir and her team argue that while long-ingrained cultural and lifestyle habits are the main risk factors to developing cancer, genetics have also a role to play.In the Nairobi study this was dramatised by the very high prevalence of skin cancers among Caucasian Kenyans. Many studies, locally and elsewhere have shown whites to be highly susceptible to skin cancer.&shy;The study associates the high levels of breast cancer among the local white and Asian populations with a&nbsp;&nbsp; uence.&ldquo;Generally, whites and Asians in Nairobi are more affluent, which is consistent with wealth being a risk factor for breast cancer.&rdquo;But with the pure Nairobi born and bred millennials now becoming a significant population in the city, Mrs Korir says cancer dynamics are bound to change in coming years.&shy;This generation, she forecasts, may possibly exhibit similar types of cancers influenced by lifestyle and exposure to the same risk factors and independent of their counties of origin.&ldquo;This is where we now take our future research,&rdquo; she said of investigations on whether traditional biases will disappear with time giving way to new cancer trends in the city.&ldquo;What emerges from our study is that no tribe in Kenya is immune to cancer with some appearing to be more susceptible to particular risk factors.&rdquo;For example, says Mrs Korir, the Kamba in Nairobi are highly prone to the skin cancer called Kaposi Sarcoma for unexplained reasons.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why but data points us in that direction. Maybe they get exposed to too much sunlight or whatever. This opens new research pathways,&rdquo; says Mrs Korir.www.rocketscience.co.ke
