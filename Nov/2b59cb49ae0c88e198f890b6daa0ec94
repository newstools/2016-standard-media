The electoral commission requires an additional Sh19.8 billion to deliver credible 2017 national polls. This brings the total cost of the August 8, 2017 polls to Sh64.8 billion, one of the highest electoral expenditures in the region. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) said the increase in budget from the initial Sh45 billion was due to changes occasioned by the Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016. The law was passed following bi-partisan deliberations between the ruling Jubilee and Opposition CORD coalitions. The new electoral law has capped the number of voters per polling station at 500, increasing the polling stations from 33,000 to 56,000 centres. The commission said the change has substantial cost and logistics implications.

Despite the additional cost, the agency said it is well-prepared to conduct the polls and ruled out calls to change the election date. &quot;The review entails adjustments within the existing timelines and does not call for an extension of the General Election date of August 8, 2017,&quot; said IEBC. &quot;However, it will call for additional funding, because of the more clerks to be employed and equipment to be deployed,&quot; it adds. The commission has harmonised the Election Operation Plan (EOP) with the new election laws. And due to the new laws that came to effect on October 4 the commission has pushed forward the Mass Voter Registration (MVR) from February next year to December to allow for the inspection of the register as recommended by the joint select committee.
