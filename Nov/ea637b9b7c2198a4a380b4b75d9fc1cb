Busia leaders want witchcraft used to `arrest&#39; killers of two watchmen and a 14year old teenager shot dead last week. The leaders led by Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa and leader of majority want witchcraft used to haunt killers of two watchmen and a 14 year old child, claiming police have failed to arrest suspects. Wangalwa said the act was in order with the Marachi customs and traditions referred to as &quot;ohutsuha ingokhe&#39; where elders will be tasked to perform some rituals on the burial day of the three. &ldquo;We have talked to our elders and since the victims were killed, appropriate traditions must be observed,&rdquo; said Wangalwa. He added, &ldquo;we will go dump the paraphernalia at specific places to ensure those responsible are haunted since there is nothing forthcoming from the police.&rdquo; Addressing the press in his office accompanied by seven members of the county assembly from Butula Sub County, Wangalwa said plans were underway to have a joint requiem mass for the deceased on Friday this week.
