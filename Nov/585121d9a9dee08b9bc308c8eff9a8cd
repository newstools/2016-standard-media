A racist Facebook post about Michelle Obama has caused an uproar in the US. The controversial post that began with a non-profit group owner, sucked in a local mayor of a small town in the US state of West Virginia before rapidly spreading across the US and the world. Pamela Ramsey Taylor, who runs a local non-profit group in Clay County, first posted on Facebook referring to the first lady as an &ldquo;ape&rdquo;. &ldquo;It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified first lady in the White House. I&rsquo;m tired of seeing ape in heels,&rdquo; she posted. Then the local mayor Beverly Whaling responded:&rdquo;Just made my day Pam.&rdquo; Ms Whaling is mayor of the town of Clay, which has a population of just 491.

Despite its small population, the controversial Facebook post rapidly spread across the US and international media outlets. A petition calling for both women to be sacked has collected more than 85,000 signatures. The Washington Post and New York Daily News reported that Ms Taylor was removed from her position on Monday. She told local news outlet WSAZ, which first carried the story, that she acknowledged her Facebook post could be &ldquo;interpreted as racist, but in no way was intended to be&rdquo;, and that she was expressing a personal opinion on attractiveness, not the colour of a person&rsquo;s skin. She told the news station she was considering legal action for slander against unnamed individuals. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
