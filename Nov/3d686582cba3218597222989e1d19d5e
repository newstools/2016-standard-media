Dry water taps are expected to start running again following the roll-out of an ambitious project to improve water infrastructure. The Sh2 billion project funded by the World Bank is being implemented in phases beginning with sealing of water leakages in Nyali and Kisauni. Mombasa Water Supply and Sanitation Company loses 50 per cent of its water through leakages and illegal connections. Since June 15, this year, the project has seen more than 700 leakages sealed. The water company&#39;s business and customer service general manager Wilson Kibet said the water company was implementing a social water policy that involved increasing access by the poor by accepting instalment payments for water connections. &quot;We are improving operation issues in order to reduce the amount of non-revenue water through leakages and illegal connections. We are also implementing a social water connection policy whereby the poor will pay a Sh1,500 deposit for connection and clear the remaining amount in 24 months,&quot; Kibet said.
