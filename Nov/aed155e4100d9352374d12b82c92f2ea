Outrage greeted the attack on Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto by police during a confrontation in his county at the weekend.Opposition leader Raila Odinga and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi led condemnation of the incident after visiting the governor at a Nairobi hospital yesterday.Raila said the incident in which the governor was hit by a tear-gas canister and sustained injuries below his eye, was an affront to the freedom of assembly, speech and association as guaranteed by the Constitution. &quot;The attack on the governor continues a worrying agenda of hate and intolerance that has taken root in the country as the Government&#39;s way of dealing with dissent and opponents, real or perceived,&quot; he said.The CORD leader said the country must not be allowed to recede into the era of primitive use of State resources for the protection of partisan and illegal political interests. &quot;We condemn this incident in very strong terms for its abrogation of the freedom of assembly, speech and association as guaranteed by the Constitution,&quot; he said.KEY LEADERSRaila said intimidation and threats have been on the lips and in the actions of key leaders of the Jubilee administration for some time now.&quot;Going by the trend, we have reason to believe things will take a more ominous turn as we get closer to elections and as Jubilee comes under greater scrutiny. It must not be allowed to shape our politics and public life again. We have been here before and we must never go there again,&quot; he said.The Baringo senator, who is also the Kanu chairman, yesterday said he was shocked by the police brutality meted out on the governor when his Chama cha Mashinani supporters clashed with Jubilee Party supporters.&quot;It is unfortunate that the police, who are meant to protect the lives of the public, are the same ones assaulting them,&quot; said Mr Moi as he urged for the calming of political tensions.The senator called on the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to immediately bring those involved to book and urged leaders to tone down political temperatures.The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) chairman Macharia Njeru said they will act on complaints, adding that if and when the complaints are reported, they will investigate and take action.&quot;We only act on complaints that are reported. Once they are reported, we investigate and take action,&quot; he said.International Centre for Policy and Conflict (ICPC) Executive Director Ndung&#39;u Wainaina condemned the action by police, asking them to be neutral and restrain themselves from acts that will endanger the lives of the civilian.&quot;When police start taking sides in a politically-charged environment like ours, then we begin to get worried. Police were heavily criticised for the 2007 mayhem and we would not want to go there,&quot; said Mr Ndung&#39;u.The governor was taken to Nairobi Hospital upon landing at the Wilson Airport at 8am following the violence at the Silibwet sports ground during a football match that had been organised by Ruto&#39;s rival, Sotik MP Joyce Laboso.He claimed Deputy President William Ruto had instructed police to disrupt his operations in the county.&quot;I know its one Deputy President who is giving orders to police to harass my people in the county,&quot; claimed the governor.The governor explained he had tried to seek the release of youths arrested at the stadium before it turned chaotic. Police lobbed tear-gas canisters, one of which hit him below his right eye.&nbsp;ATTENDING CHURCH&nbsp;He explained that he was attending a church service at Njerian African Gospel Church (AGC), Silibwet , when he received text messages of complaints from youths attending a football match at Silibwet stadium.After the church service, Ruto said he went to the stadium to intervene and on arrival, a huge crowd gathered around him. An argument ensued between him and the police officers.&quot;A police officer in uniform tried to hit me with a baton but my security thwarted the move and a heated confrontation ensued before around 10 officers retreated and lobbed tear-gas canisters directly at me,&quot; he said.However, Laboso accused the governor of storming the event, saying his action was uncalled for.She said trying to disrupt a peaceful event in the pretext of helping youth was unbecoming.
