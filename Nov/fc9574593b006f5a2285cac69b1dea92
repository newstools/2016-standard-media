Almost a third fewer women than men in the world&rsquo;s poorest countries are connected to the Internet and the gap is set to widen, limiting access to life-changing opportunities, an anti-poverty group has said. A study by the ONE Organisation, co-founded by Irish rock star Bono to tackle extreme poverty, found 18 per cent of men in the 48 least developed nations are online versus 12.5 per cent of women, with a gender gap of 22.3 million or about 30 per cent.The analysis, released at Europe&rsquo;s biggest tech event, the Web Summit, forecast the digital gender divide would widen further by 2020 to about 32 per cent when factoring in population growth and current internet trends, to a gap of 53.5 million.The report said a global target set by UN member states last year to have universal affordable internet access in the least developed countries by 2020 was off track.
