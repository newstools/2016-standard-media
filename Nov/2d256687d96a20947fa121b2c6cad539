Construction of the Sh4 billion Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) headquarters in Kisumu will start after a 10-year delay. Ali Matano, the LVBC Executive Secretary said the Secretariat is sourcing for funds to put up the regional offices and had established a kitty for line ministries to mobilise funds from various foundations.
