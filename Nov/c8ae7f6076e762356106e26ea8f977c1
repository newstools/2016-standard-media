MERU: A youth lobby has called for alteration of the recently-unveiled Jubilee Party campaign teams, citing lack of representation.The Mount Kenya Youth Caucus said they felt youths were ignored when the campaign teams were named by President Uhuru Kenyatta during the JP&#39;s National Governing Council meeting at the Bomas of Kenya, last week.&quot;The youth constitute a big chunk of the voting block and we are not happy because the campaign teams in the Mount Kenya region are made up of the old guard,&quot; said Linford Mutembei, the lobby&#39;s chairman. Speaking to the press Monday, Mr Mutembei said the youths were not satisfied with the line-ups to spearhead JP campaigns in Mount Kenya, because they were composed of mainly elderly and wealthy politicians.&quot;The campaign teams do not represent the youth&#39;s aspirations. We face the biggest challenges including unemployment, poverty and lack of opportunities for our own development, so we definitely are not happy with the Jubilee campaign team&#39;s composition,&quot; added Mutembei.&quot;We feel we were taken for granted because we were not consulted when these teams were being constituted. The youth must be consulted in Jubilee affairs. We want representatives of the youth in all Mount Kenya counties to be included in the teams spearheading JP interests,&quot; he added.Mutembei said youths in Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Kiambu, Nyeri, Laikipia, Murang&#39;a, Isiolo, and Embu were keenly following events to see if the Jubilee&#39;s top leadership will re-think the composition of the teams.&quot;When we look at those spearheading Jubilee campaigns in Meru, Nyeri, Nakuru, Kajiado and other counties we do not see people who represent the youth&#39;s dreams and challenges. That is why we want the current teams disbanded and reconstituted,&quot; he said.
