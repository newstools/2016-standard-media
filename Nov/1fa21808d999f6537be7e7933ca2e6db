Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony has asked a water agency to expedite the construction of a Sh20 billion dam. The governor said the National Water and Pipeline Corporation should ensure the Soin-Koru water dam project is completed on time. Prof Chepkwony said although his administration was in the process of expanding the Kericho Water and Sanitation Company as a stop-gap to the semi-dry Soin/Sigowet constituency, lack of resources had limited the project. Speaking in Soko Huru trading centre in Soin ward, Chepkwony asked MCAs to fast-track the passage of the County equalisation Bill so that areas such as Soin/Sigowet can be transformed.
