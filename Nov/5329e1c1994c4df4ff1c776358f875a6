A man killed his wife and seriously injured his three-year-old son before killing himself at Bandani village in Kisumu.The young boy was admitted to Kisumu District Hospital with severe wounds on the head, face and the neck after the Monday night incident.Witnesses said Willis Otieno, 30, allegedly attacked the two at their rented house after domestic wrangles. Sources said his wife Millicent Ouma, 26, had threatened to dump him.Their six-year-old daughter reportedly escaped the wrath of the man as she fled to her aunt&rsquo;s house in a neighbouring estate.Most neighbours declined to speak to the Press over the incident, saying they had no information on the incident.Some friends, however, said the couple had been having constant wrangles.Packing belongings&ldquo;Millicent was seen during the day packing her belongings. She looked like she wanted to travel but it was not known whether she had differed with the husband,&rdquo; said Absalom Omondi, a neighbour.Omondi said he was called by a friend who found Millicent lying outside her house in a pool of blood on Monday night.&ldquo;She was lying in a pool of blood and in so much pain. She had a deep wound in the throat, and was struggling to breathe, while the injured baby was sitting beside her, pushing the mother to wake up in vain,&rdquo; he said.The assailant is said to have disappeared after the incident.The landlady, Bethia Aluoch, confirmed that she was woken up early in the morning by the persistent cry of a child but when she went out, she found a body within the compound.&ldquo;The couple had stayed here for barely a month. I do not engage much with my tenants so I do not know if they had any misunderstanding between them,&rdquo; said Aluoch.Yesterday morning, Otieno&rsquo;s body was discovered in a nearby thicket, with neighbours suspecting he might have taken poison.County Police Commander Titus Yoma confirmed the incident, saying investigations had been launched.
