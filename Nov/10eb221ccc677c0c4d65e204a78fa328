Relatives and friends who turned up at the Wilson Airport on Tuesday evening to receive Loise Njoki when she returned from Somalia. [Photos/Elvis Ogina/standard] &quot;My name is Loise Njoki... and I want to give thanks for what God has done.&quot; These were the first words Ms Njoki, who has been held captive for close to two years in Somalia, uttered when she emerged out of Nairobi&#39;s Wilson Airport last Tuesday. She raised her frail hands as tears flowed uncontrollably down her cheeks, her mind obviously filled with flashbacks of what she has gone through in Somalia in one year and 11 long months. &quot;I am so happy that I have seen all of you. Two years is a long time, I have a lot to say. I can talk and talk. But I just want to say God is great. I am free and I escaped unhurt,&quot; said Njoki who looked much older than her 34 years. Njoki, who hails from Bahati in Nakuru County, has been held by pirates in Somalia&#39;s Galmudug region and was freed in a military operation on Saturday.

Those who had turned up at the airport had been warned by the delegation&#39;s head Samuel Kariithi that no one should hug Njoki as she was still weak. The people, led by Njoki&#39;s elder sister Mary Weru, beat their drums, which they had brought along, and sang songs, praising God for the miracle. Njoki joined them in praising God. &quot;All that time, I was dying to see is my daughter. I cannot pay back your prayers but this is proof that God can do anything. If you do not believe then listen to Sarah Kiarie&#39;s song, &#39;Liseme&#39;,&quot; Njoki told the crowd. When it was confirmed at 6.30pm Njoki had arrived, her&nbsp; daughter stormed into the airport to meet her mother as friends and relatives waited a whole hour outside to see her. The reception turned into a small church service, complete&nbsp; with prayers and songs. Eventually, a cake was served to celebrate the miraculous return. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
