There is music in the air for Kenyan artistes should the Music Bill become law. For many decades, majority of popular musicians have led a life of poverty despite putting a smile and a spring on many a Kenyan leg. They have been denied royalties as the multitude of agencies purporting to speak for them swindled them of their hard earned cash.The new Bill seeks to create a single agency, preferably at the Kenya Revenue Authority, to collect artistes&#39; dues. Public Service Vehicles, hotels and entertainment joints have been playing music to lure clients but have done little to compensate the originators of the creative compositions. The duplication of roles has made it hard for musicians to get their real worth in an industry replete with tricksters.In the meantime, real talent has been stifled and growth of the potential multi-billion shilling industry dealt a huge blow, where only a few elite survive. As has been said before, the creative arts industry has a capacity to create opportunities for millions of youths. The Jubilee government rode into power in 2013, with a promise to the young people of expanded opportunities. The creative industry should provide a huge avenue to deliver on this pledge.
