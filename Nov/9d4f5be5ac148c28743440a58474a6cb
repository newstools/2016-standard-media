USA: Demonstrators in major U.S. cities took to the streets on Sunday for a fifth straight day to protest President-elect Donald Trump, whose campaign manager said President Barack Obama and Democrat Hillary Clinton should do more to support a peaceful transition. Following several nights of unrest, crowds of people marched in parks in New York City, San Francisco and Oakland, California, according to social media. A few thousand joined a march at the south end of Manhattan&#39;s Central Park, beginning at a Trump property on Columbus Circle and walking toward the real estate mogul&#39;s skyscraper headquarters less than a mile (1.6 km) away. They chanted: &quot;Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcomed here,&quot; and held signs such as &quot;White silence = violence&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t mourn, organize.&quot; One protester said demonstrators were reclaiming what the American flag he was holding stood for. &quot;The flag means freedom of speech, freedom of religion, equal protection under the law and other values like diversity, respecting differences, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press,&quot; said Daniel Hayman, 31, of Seattle, who was in New York for work. &quot;We&#39;re trying to reclaim the flag and push forward those values.&quot; READ MORE Trump's win and clash of civilisations How Trump exploited the disaffection among whites Trump hires Republican insider, conservative firebrand for White House Thousands in several cities have demonstrated since the results from Tuesday&#39;s election showed Trump, a Republican, lost the popular tally but secured enough votes in the 538-member Electoral College to win the presidency, surprising the world. Largely peaceful demonstrators in urban areas have said Trump threatens their civil and human rights. They have decried Trump&#39;s often inflammatory campaign rhetoric about illegal immigrants, Muslims and women, as well as allegations, which he denies, that the former reality TV star sexually abused women. Dozens have been arrested, including 71 in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday night, according to police, and a handful of police injured. &#39;LET&#39;S MAKE WAVES&#39; In San Francisco on Sunday, about 1,000 people marched through Golden Gate Park toward a beach where they chanted: &quot;Let&#39;s make waves.&quot; They held signs such as &quot;I resist racism&quot; and &quot;Down with the Trumps.&quot; Across the bay in Oakland, thousands of protesters joined a festival-like atmosphere, holding peace signs and blowing soap bubbles in the sunshine. Many had brought their children, aiming to hold hands around the 3.4-mile (5.5-km) circumference of Lake Merritt in a popular urban park. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
