Five head teachers were injured when&nbsp;a police vehicle transporting KCSE papers was involved in an accident&nbsp;along the Meru-Chuka road&nbsp;yesterday. The driver of the vehicle, which was carrying&nbsp;five school principals and five security officers, was trying to avoid a&nbsp;head-on-collision when he lost control of the vehicle. It veered off the road and landed in a ditch. The principals were from Kajiampau, Kathanje, Murungi, Nitubara and Kathwana secondary schools in Tharaka region of Tharaka Nithi County. The injured were taken to&nbsp;Chogoria Mission hospital where&nbsp;Ann Nanu and John Miri of Murungi and Nitubara were treated and discharged. Jannifer Kinya of Kajiampau and Godfrey Mutegi of Kathanje were transferred to Mater Hospital in Nairobi, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) said. Meru South police Chief Beatrice Kiraguri confirmed the accident, saying the driver was trying to avoid hitting an on-coming vehicle when he veered off the road and landed in a ditch. TSC said the head teachers&#39; deputies would take over their duties as they recuperate. &nbsp;
