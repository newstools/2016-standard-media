Mega supermarkets and banks operating in the county could be forced to close if they fail to build toilets for their clients. Health Executive Peninah Mukabane said a policy directive requiring that all business premises should have clean and accessible toilets for customers must be adhered to by all business owners in the area. ODF CERTIFIED &ldquo;I am directing county public health officers to launch a crackdown on premises that have not adhered to the directive so that we do not procrastinate implementing critical policy guidelines.&rdquo; She regretted that most business premises in the area lack toilets despite having many clients frequenting their places.

So far, the campaign has been launched in 238 villages in Butere and Khwisero constituencies, according to the official.
