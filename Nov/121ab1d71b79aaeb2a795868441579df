Questions have been raised over the 61-member team that will steer Jubilee Party (JP) campaigns as it emerged that key Rift Valley counties were overlooked. In the list that has the who-is-who in the JP political hierarchy, not a single politician from Nandi, Kericho, Uasin Gishu, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet, the political bedrock of Deputy President William Ruto, was included in President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s 2017 campaign secretariat. It is not clear what issues were considered in constituting the team as key Rift Valley leaders were left out. Expectations in the Rift Valley were that a key party campaign team such as the one unveiled by President Kenyatta and his deputy would have a greater presence of leaders from the key stronghold. In the list read to party members during a Special National Delegate Congress (NDC) at the Bomas of Kenya recently, National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso (Bomet), Senator John Munyes (Turkana) and Woman Representatives Joyce Emanikor (Turkana), Soipan Tuya (Narok) and Janet Nangabo (Trans Nzoia) were chosen as representatives of the populous Rift Valley region. Kanu factor Others are West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin, Loitoktok MP Katoo Ole Metito, Nakuru County Assembly Speaker Susan Kihika and chairman of People With Disability (PWD) David Sankok.

The Jubilee coalition draws 41 governors, senators and MPs from the five Kalenjin counties of Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Kericho and Uasin Gishu, as well as Rongai, Kuresoi North and South constituencies. Kaseret Member of County Assembly Pauline Tuwei says some of the notable personalities who should have been considered are Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and his Nandi counterpart Stephen Sang. &ldquo;Who will speak to the people on the ground if notable leaders from the region have not been included?&rdquo; wondered Ms Tuwei. Longisa (Bomet) MCA Stephen Changmorik said the appointment of Laboso could be a strategy by JP to subdue the influence of Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto&rsquo;s Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party. Changmorik believes Laboso&rsquo;s appointment may be an attempt to tame the Bomet governor and hopefully claw back the gains he has made with his party in the county. Eleven Members of the County Assembly (MCA) from Bomet defected to CCM when URP dissolved into JP. Similarly, Kanu&rsquo;s significant influence in West Pokot could have informed the selection of Governor Kachapin. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
