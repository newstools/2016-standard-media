BERLIN:&nbsp;Germany&#39;s Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen described Donald&nbsp;Trump&#39;s gains in the U.S. presidential election as a &quot;huge shock&quot; on Wednesday and asked him for assurances on his commitment to NATO.Von der Leyen told broadcaster ARD that the Republican candidate&#39;s strong showing was &quot;not a vote for him but rather against Washington, against the establishment&quot;.&quot;It was a big shock when I saw the way things are heading,&quot; she said as&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;edged closer to&nbsp;winning&nbsp;the White House with a series of shocking&nbsp;wins&nbsp;in key states such as Florida and Ohio, rattling world markets.Germany, like other European countries, was alarmed byTrump&#39;s comments earlier in the campaign that if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the targeted country had met its defence commitments before providing military aid.&quot;Of course we Europeans, as a NATO ally, know that if DonaldTrump&nbsp;becomes president, he&#39;ll ask: What are you contributing to this alliance?&quot; von der Leyen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s conservatives, said.&quot;But we&#39;re also wondering, what&#39;s your position on this alliance?&quot; she added, in the first comments from a German minister on the U.S. vote.Von der Leyen said the German government now needed to find out know who their contact person would be in a&nbsp;Trumpgovernment and what campaign announcements he wanted to implement.&quot;There are many questions yet to be answered,&quot; she said.Regarding&nbsp;Trump&#39;s pledge to &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;, von der Leyen said that would only be possible with a strong economy and that, in turn, would only be possible if he did not create uncertainty.&quot;It&#39;s in our interest that the America remains prepared to take on responsibility and open to the world,&quot; she said.
