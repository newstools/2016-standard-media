NAIROBI, KENYA: National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) has introduced stringent guidelines on the sale of government subsidized fertiliser in an effort to keep out unscrupulous individuals.One of the key rules is that only farmers registered with the Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries will access subsidised fertiliser.In a circular to all depots and regional managers NCPB Managing Director Newton Terer explained that the move was an effort to ensure only genuine farmers who are in the Ministry Database are benefiting from government support. &ldquo;Farmers&#39; registration is to be carried out by county agricultural officers in the sub county and ward level,&rdquo; Terer noted.A data bank of farmers who had earlier benefited from subsidised fertiliser has been circulated to all county directors of Agriculture for verification and confirmation.Farmers hoping to benefit from the government subsidised fertilizer have received a reprieve as registration of farmers will continue and the register updated at Ministry of Agriculture headquarters.The National databank register from the ministry of Agriculture shall serve both the subsidised fertilisers farmers and maize farmers.According to the regulations, vetting of farmers is expected to also be carried out before they are allowed to access the NCPB depot for their fertiliser.Each farmers must fill out a form showing the crops he intends to grow and quantity of&nbsp;fertiliser he requires to purchase.The vetting committee should verify if the quantities required by the farmers are available depending on the distribution lists compiled by the officials.Officers vetting farmers must submit their specimen signatures to the NCPB Regional Manager, and Depot Manager of the locality in advance.&quot;The silo manager must authenticate the signatures on the vetting forms to confirm they are genuine, from the authorized signatories on the vetting committee,&quot; the guidelines stated.NCPB Depot Managers will bear responsibility for the authentication of vouchers and only once these voucher is approved can a farmer then pay for the fertiliser.Counties that run out of subsidised&nbsp;fertiliser will have to undergo stringent analysis and approval from the NCPB regional managers.
