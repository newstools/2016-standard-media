Competition in the Public Service Vehicles (PSV) segment is set to increase with Toyota Kenya set to introduce a new 16-seater luxury shuttle under its Toyota Hiace brand. The vehicle, which has been specifically designed for the long distance segment of the matatu industry, will be available in either a 14-seater or a 16-seater shuttle.The Hiace &ldquo;New Shark&rdquo; is about half a metre longer than the Toyota Hiace. It comes equipped with the latest fuel efficiency and fleet management systems, enabling vehicle owners to not only save on fuel but also monitor the vehicle&rsquo;s fuel consumption. Toyota Kenya Deputy Managing Director Arvinder Reel said in a statement the new vehicle will besides increasing the profits of operators also offer a more convenient and luxurious mode of travel for long-distance travellers. &ldquo;Most long-distance travellers prefer shuttles because they have a shorter waiting time and are faster compared to buses that often have longer travel times and take longer to fill up at bus stations,&rdquo; said Mr Reel.
