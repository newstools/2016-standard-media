NAIROBI, KENYA: A partnership between Bamburi Cement and a global waste management firm will see the manufacturer produce energy and raw materials from the unwanted products.Geocycle has entered into a partnership with the cement manufacturer that will see the firm&#39;s Kenyan subsidiary Geocycle Kenya incinerate waste in Bamburi&#39;s kilns.During the incineration, Bamburi will tap energy from the kilns that burn at averagely 2,000 degrees hence possibly cut on the high cost of power associated with running manufacturing industries in the country. At the same time, Bamburi will be able to get raw materials from the ashes of the fuel used to heat the kilns which creates clinker that is later ground to form cement.Bamburi Chief Executive Officer Bruno Pescheux described the partnership as timely considering that Geocycle&#39;s waste management solution leaves no residue after disposal.This also makes Geocycle Kenya the only waste managing firm in the country with such technology that runs from collection, transportation, and segregation to disposal with zero waste residues as per the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) 2015 strategy.&quot;The current waste management solutions focus on dumpsites, open burning and incineration of hazardous and medical waste. Such do not result to zero waste and have adverse impact to the environment and society,&quot; said Pescheux.Apart from the hazardous medical waste, Geocycle will also be recycling used tyres, and other solid wastes.He said the technology which is utilised internationally will ensure nil toxic emissions: &quot;The partnership will leverage on Geocycle&#39;s worldwide presence to implement innovative technologies, adapt best practices and use international approaches to provide waste management solutions in Kenya.&quot;Head of Geocycle Kenya Simon Wathigo noted that big chunks of waste generated in the country are from by-products of manufacturing, service, industrial and agricultural processes.In Nairobi alone with a population of 3.8 million persons the city coughs out 3,000 tons of waste which just 10 per cent is recycled. With Dandora dump site 98 per cent full, Wathigo noted that it is a high time an alternative solution is sought as the population is rapidly growing.&quot;The biggest challenge in waste management is at the final stage of discarding as county and waste management companies do not have the mechanisms to ensure zero residue,&quot; said Wathigo.
