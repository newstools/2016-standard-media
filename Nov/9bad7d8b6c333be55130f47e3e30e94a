The&nbsp;Judiciary&nbsp;never lost money in the construction of pre-fabricated courts, a witness had said in court. Bridgit Chepkemoi said materials that were to be used to build the court in Mavoko were taken to Runyenjes after it emerged that the piece of land was under dispute. &quot;Contrary to claims by the prosecution that the&nbsp;Judiciary&nbsp;incurred losses over the Mavoko court, materials that were to be used on that court were used to build the one in Runyenjes,&quot; said Ms Chepkemoi. &quot;On realising the Mavoko land, which had been given to the&nbsp;Judiciary&nbsp;by then district commissioner, Makori Mose, belonged to the Kenya Meat Commission and had unsettled hurdles,&nbsp;it was agreed that the pre-fabricated court would be put up in Runyenjes because the&nbsp;Judiciary&nbsp;could not prove ownership (of the land).&quot; Chepkemoi, a Nakuru court executive officer, said tender money was also secured and that the&nbsp;Judiciary&nbsp;could recover its money in the event anything untoward happened from the bidders&#39; side. &quot;From where you stand, do you see it as a benefit to Timsales? Is there anything improper?&quot; lawyer Edwin Sifuna asked. Chepkemoi answered: &quot;There was nothing improper.&quot; READ MORE Don in bid to stop hiring of anti-graft boss The most corrupt departments in Laikipia MCAs to discuss claims Speaker stole from athlete The court heard that the payment had been secured through CFC Bank. Senior Principal Magistrate Liz Chege also heard that there was no ceiling set for a down payment in case any company won the tenders for building the courts. She said there was nothing wrong with the 50 per cent down payment paid to Timsales Ltd as no ceiling was set by the evaluation committee. &quot;Down payment was not a criteria for evaluation. The criteria used&nbsp;did&nbsp;not come from the&nbsp;Judiciary. It was in accordance with procurement laws,&quot; said Chepkemoi. &quot;There was no complaint from any of the 13 bidders regarding the process. I am not aware of any complaint,&quot; she said, adding the tender committee recommended Timsales for the tender after demanding that the&nbsp;Judiciary&nbsp;should make a 50 per cent payment at the start. Former&nbsp;Judiciary&nbsp;Chief Registrar Gladys Shollei and six others have been charged with altering the down payment from 10 per cent to 50 per cent. However, the witness said it was the company that demanded to be paid 50 per cent before starting the work. At least 60 per cent of the work was to be done in a workshop and the rest on site.
