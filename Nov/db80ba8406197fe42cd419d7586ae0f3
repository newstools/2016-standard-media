Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto said Kenyans should not be hoodwinked to continue supporting the Government with false development promises. He criticised Jubilee saying it had failed to contain slay the corruption dragon. Mr Ruto warned that the situation would get worse if Jubilee is re-elected in 2017. &quot;We should stand up for the country and our concern heard clearly in the next elections before the situation gets out of hand,&quot; he said. Ruto called for further questioning of former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru, saying she has plenty of information on the people behind the National Youth Service scam that saw nearly a billion shillings stolen. He asked Kenyans to shun voting along tribal lines, saying only individuals with the interests of the larger population should be elected. &quot;We should not mind who gets elected but only be keen on the agenda that whoever will be president is pursuing,&quot; Ruto said. The governor said Jubilee was using the tribal card to mobilise voters&nbsp;in a bid to retain power.
