Kisii, Kenya: Several people have been injured while others are feared trapped inside a 13-storey building which was under construction in Kisii Town. The injured have been rushed to Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. Hospital CEO Dr Enock Ondari says they have put in place a team of medical personnel to help with the emergency. Kisii Governor James Ongwae and his Nyamira Counterpart John Nyagarama have visited the scene. A rescue team from the Kisii County Disaster Management have already started the rescue mission. In September last year, another building collapsed a day after tenants had been evacuated. A few years ago another building collapsed just a few meters from today&#39;s scene of incident.
