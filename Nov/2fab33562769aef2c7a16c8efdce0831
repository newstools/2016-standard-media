Aspirants are looking for endorsements as the race for governorship hots up ahead of next year&rsquo;s General Election.On Saturday, over 1,000 elders from Mbeere endorsed Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire for the position and asked her to explain how their clans would benefit if she was elected.Also present during the function were National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, county Speaker Kariuki Mate and Mbeere North MP Muriuki Njagagua. This came just a week after 39 so-called smaller clans from Mbeere endorsed Senator Lenny Kivuti for governor.However, the move has elicited condemnation from other aspirants, including former Transport Permanent Secretary Cyrus Njiru and Deputy Governor Dorothy Nditi, who say the endorsements may trigger animosity among different clans.&nbsp;TRIBAL MEETINGSThey have accused unnamed national leaders of presiding over tribal meetings in the region instead of spearheading unity and cohesion among the people.Another aspirant, Njagi Kumantha said these endorsements have violated an earlier agreement that Embu should produce the governor and Mbeere the deputy governor.&ldquo;The agreement was based on the premise that since Embu is comically well off compared to Mbeere, they should take the bigger seat lest a governor from the other side be accused of diverting their wealth,&rdquo; he said.Njiru said someone close to President Uhuru Kenyatta is involved in tribal and clan politics in the region. He asked the cohesion commission to investigate the matter before it triggers animosity among the people.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to believe that the national leader is supporting a candidate based on clan as that would be going against the President&rsquo;s spirit of uniting all Kenyan communities,&rdquo; Dr Njiru said.
