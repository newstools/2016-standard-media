A pupil who sat his&nbsp;Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams last week collapsed and died in Naivasha yesterday. The 15-year-old boy had embarked on an expedition around Lake Naivasha. According to Peter Wafula, a resident of Korongo, the teenager who loved nature was on a bird-watching mission. &quot;He just did his KCPE exams in one of the primary schools in the area and this is a loss not only to the family but to the community at large,&quot; he said. Naivasha Assistant County Commissioner John Opondo confirmed the incident, saying the body had been taken to the sub-county hospital mortuary. &quot;We do not know whether he had been sick or what led to his collapse. Only a postmortem examination will help establish (the cause of death),&quot; he said.

A day after a guard was murdered when thugs raided Society Stores Supermarket, more police officers were deployed to the town to carry out 24-hour patrols. Residents believe the recently released petty offenders could be behind the criminal acts. Naivasha Deputy County Commissioner Isaac Masinde said officers from all the units had been deployed to guard life and property as the town prepares for Christmas festivities.
