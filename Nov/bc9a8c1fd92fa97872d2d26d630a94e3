The choice of former minister Raphael Tuju as head of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s campaign team has been viewed as a two-pronged political scheme.It is both a strategy aimed at stemming internal wrangles in the Jubilee Party and giving it a national outlook. The fact that Mr Tuju was not allied to factions within Jubilee and is not planning to run for a political seat also made him the best bet for Uhuru and his deputy, William Ruto.Jubilee has been experiencing internal wrangles over party positions, which threatened to spark falling-out among the 12 merged parties.And being from Opposition leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s backyard of Nyanza, Tuju&rsquo;s appointment also comes with political undertones that Jubilee Party was ready to take on Raila in his stronghold come next year&rsquo;s polls, as well as, bring &ldquo;all Kenyans&rdquo; to its fold.Uhuru and Ruto allies and political pundits are in agreement that the President made &ldquo;a wise choice&rdquo; in picking the former Rarieda MP, citing his political experience and diplomatic approach to matters.On Friday, while announcing the appointment of Tuju, President Kenyatta said the new team was tasked with planning and organising party meetings and rallies to explain Jubilee agenda, and would be meeting every two weeks.National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki, Deputy National Assembly Speaker Joyce Laboso, nominated MP Johnson Sakaja, Tetu MP Ndungu Gethenji, former minister and Nairobi gubernatorial aspirant Margaret Wanjiru and ex-minister Kalembe Ndile expressed confidence in Tuju&rsquo;s appointment, citing his political experience.The leaders said Uhuru wanted somebody who was neutral and who would not be consumed by internal political intrigues of the party.Mr Duale said since Tuju was not running for a political seat in the coming elections, he has the energy needed to manage the campaigns as well as remain impartial to any factions in running the affairs of the party.Key roleHe said Tuju played a key role in retired President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s election in 2002 as head of the communication wing of the campaign team, stating that he would create synergy in the campaigns.&ldquo;He is not vying for any political seat and as such, he will have the energy to run the campaigns. His appointment is also a clear signal that Jubilee Party is a national outfit. The President&rsquo;s mission is to unite the people,&rdquo; said Duale.Political analyst Adams Oloo said Jubilee was forced to create a parallel structure because of pressure to name party officials.Dr Oloo argued that the appointment of Tuju was to make the outfit look as neither TNA nor URP to avoid wrangles since the dissolved parties would have claimed the two parties were still playing the big brother role.&ldquo;By picking Tuju, they are looking for somebody from Raila&rsquo;s backyard to hit at him during the campaigns,&rdquo; said Oloo.Communication consultant Barrack Muluka said Uhuru got it right in picking Tuju but failed in picking the national campaign committee.&ldquo;His appointment is meant to address the baggage of internal wrangles. He is a neutral person that cannot be associated with any factions with the party,&rdquo; said Mr Muluka.Political analyst Peter Kagwanja said it was not a surprise that Uhuru settled on Tuju, noting that the two have kept a close working and personal relationship since Kibaki&rsquo;s regime.Prof Kagwanja said by picking Tuju, Uhuru was trying to create a bridge across regions.
