A Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) candidate gave birth to twins in Likuyani sub-county and named one of them after Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i. She becomes the third candidate to deliver safely while sitting exams in Kakamega County and the second in Likuyani constituency. The young mother had barely sat for 20 minutes in examination room at Vinyenya Secondary School when she went into labour, forcing invigilators and the school principal to make arrangements for her to be rushed to nearby Mabusi Health Centre. &quot;Her bundle of joy came in an interval of 30 minutes and we thank God because the delivery process was successful,&quot; said Likuyani Sub-County Education Officer David Esemere. He said the candidate went on with her CRE Paper 1 examination from her hospital bed after the safe delivery.

Her mother Florence Wanyonyi said they decided to name one of her grandsons after Mr Matiang&#39;i because of the exemplary work the CS had done in curbing cheating in national examinations. Other two candidates, one from St Boniface Mbagara Secondary School in Lugari and another one from Likuyani, were forced to sit part of their examinations from hospital after giving birth.
