When the 2010 Constitution was enacted, it placed an obligation upon the Government to provide quality public services and information &ndash; as a fundamental and constitutional right of all Kenyans.This was the expectation of many Kenyans, mostly the youth, when this administration came into office. Kenyans, indeed, deserved ethical and efficient services in respect to their present social realities. The Government, therefore, prioritised transformation of public service provision to fulfil the constitutional demands. Indeed, in the words of President Uhuru Kenyatta; &ldquo;we cannot transform Kenya if we do not transform the Public Service&rdquo;.The single criterion to measure the success of the Public Service transformation process must be at the level of effectiveness - whether services that are delivered meet the expectations of all Kenyans.It can then be argued that public servants have a fiduciary responsibility, which calls for effective performance of their duties to achieve the best practices with the best use of the available resources.Those responsible for how public resources are utilised should periodically review their methods and in some cases consider some other ways that achieve the balance of economy, efficiency and effectiveness while maintaining a commitment to equity and accountability.Established soon after this administration took office, Huduma centres have transformed public service and put governance at the heart of public service provision by eliminating bureaucracy and unnecessary delays that used to cause public frustration and created a conducive environment for corruption.Over 35,000 Kenyans are served daily at Huduma Centres and 9.5 million Kenyans have been served satisfactorily since the establishment of Huduma Kenya Programme. At least Sh12 billion has been generated for the Government by this programme.Last Friday, I inspected the establishment of the 42nd Huduma Centre in the country in Murang&rsquo;a soon after Lamu, while another three centres will be fully operational by end of this month in Narok, Marsabit, and Migori counties. Six other counties of Elgeyo Marakwet, Tana River, West Pokot, Bomet, Mandera and Vihiga will have their centres by March next year.Our strategy is to have a Huduma Centre in each county and the following have already been established in many places including Nairobi GPO, Nairobi City square, Makadara, Eastleigh, Kibra, Mombasa, Bungoma, Siaya, Garissa, Nandi, Kitui, Makueni, Embu, Kisumu, Kisii, Kakamega, Kajiado, Machakos, Tharaka Nithi, Homa Bay, Meru, Isiolo, Wajir, Turkana and Nyeri.The array of Huduma Centre services is now at 60 &ndash; ranging from the registration of welfare groups and the search and registration of business names to assessment and payment of Stamp Duty; from issuance of duplicate ID cards and student loan applications to renewal of driving licenses; from NHIF registration and claims to payment of rents and rates.The success of the Huduma Centres is adding jet propulsion to the Vision 2030 aim of achieving a people-centred, transparent and accountable public service that responds to public needs and provides public services that meet global standards and best practice in the early 21st Century.Huduma Kenya has grown rapidly since it was launched, won accolades locally and internationally, and created a strong brand in a short time. Over 16 African countries are already studying the Huduma Centre concept and regard the organisation as a platform to address poor public service delivery.On our part, we shall ensure Huduma Centres continue to excel and extend its operations to the grassroots level in its typical corrupt free environment so that more Kenyans experience access to Government services at one-stop Citizen Service Centres, a model for public service.The greatest plus of the seamlessness of the Huduma Centres is their operating model of Integrated Service Delivery. It provides the citizen with multiple-channel, single-window access to government services at one-stop Citizen Service Centres, complete with call centres, mobile phone platforms and web portals.Huduma is a vast deliverable, ensuring that the National Government&rsquo;s services are seamlessly and efficiently taken, as a matter of State obligation and human right, to all 47 counties and complementing the devolved system in its entirety.Huduma Kenya Programme, on its part, will continue to be trusted by the public if they sustain their good job, treat people fairly, keep their promises and admit responsibility for and rectify mistakes. Continued performance in this areas will help to solidify public trust they enjoy today.
