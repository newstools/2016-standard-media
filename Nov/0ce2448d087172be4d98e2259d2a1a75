Quick action by police saved a 10-year-old girl from the blunt knife of a traditional circumciser. A team of police officers stormed a compound in Kuria East on Sunday and interrupted a traditional ceremony in which the girl was to be forcefully circumcised. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is illegal in Kenya. Eight suspects, including the girl&#39;s parents and an executive member of the Kuria Council of Elders, were arrested in the raid. Two elderly women who were scheduled to perform the outlawed ritual were also nabbed. According to area OCPD Evans Wanyonyi, the operation was carried out in both Kuria East and West. He said the police were privy to information that the community was planning to launch circumcision rituals over the December school holidays. Mr Wanyonyi said the rescue operation began on Friday, when police arrested four elderly suspects. &quot;On Sunday, we were tipped about others who had rented a hut in Komomange, Kuria East, in preparation to circumcise a young girl,&quot; he said. The OCPD, Deputy Commissioner Okiring&#39; Ajalet and other law enforcers stormed the compound and found&nbsp; assorted tools and traditional paraphernalia used in the rituals.
