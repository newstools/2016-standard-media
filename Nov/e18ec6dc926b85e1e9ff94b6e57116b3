The county government is working with the World Bank to establish a regional disease control centre to boost livestock production. The centre will help in surveillance, detection, prevention and treatment of animals besides offering consultancy services to residents. The only other similar centre is in Kabete, Kiambu County. Governor Ali Roba who spoke in Mandera Town said the centre will save farmers from the huge losses they have been incurring as their livestock die due to lack of treatment. &quot;The centre is at an advanced stage and will help to investigate specimen quickly. In the meantime, we are getting expert veterinarians from Nairobi to boost the response programme we are currently running to minimise losses as a result of the prevailing drought,&quot;&nbsp; Roba said. Residents have raised concerns over perennial disease outbreaks, especially during dry seasons, that have robbed them of their livelihoods.
