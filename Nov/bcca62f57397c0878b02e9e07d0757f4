An armed gang raided Ragati coffee factory in Ndia constituency, Kirinyaga County Saturday night and stole 63 bags of coffee valued at Sh1.8 million. The gang stormed the factory at about 10 pm on Saturday and rounded up all the four guards on duty before packing the coffee beans into their bags bearing Tanzanian labels which read &#39;&#39;Arabica Coffee, a produce of Tanzania&#39;&#39;. The factory is one of the 10 others which form the Kibirigwe Coffee Cooperative Society and produces some of the top grades of the commodity, according to the society chairman Joseph Maina. Maina who was among farmers who rushed to the factory upon learning of the incident said the gang came with its own bags they used to steal the coffee and left others within the premises. He said it was unfortunate that during this season three such robberies have occurred within the same society. &#39;&#39;The first robbery took place at Kiangai coffee factory where our night guard was killed by the gangsters but they were repulsed before they could steal any parchment which was in the store,&#39;&#39; the official said.

County Police Commander Joseph Nthenge who was also rushed to the factory the same night said they have launched investigations over the matter. He said although no arrests have been made during the three incidents, his officers were following all possible leads to bring the culprits to book.
