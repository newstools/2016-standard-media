NAIROBI: A woman has been arrested for spreading a malicious report claiming that Family Bank was about to be put under receivership.The woman identified as Christine Gachiko Njeri, 35 and who is a businesswoman in Nairobi was arrested Friday evening from her house by detectives from Banking Fraud Investigation Unit. Unit boss Ngatia Iregi said they had been investigating the matter since Wednesday when the message started to spread on social media. &ldquo;We have established she was behind the malicious message. She is under interrogation as we look for more who may have shared the same knowingly or unknowingly,&rdquo; said Iregi.He added his officers deployed technology to make the strides and hoped more suspects will be caught in the probe and face charges.The message had apparently caused panic among the bank customers with some rushing to withdraw their cash.The bank had said the source of the message has been under investigations by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.&ldquo;We reassure our 1.7 million customers that we are open for business and you can count on us to continue serving you,&rdquo; reads the statement in part. &ldquo;Rest assured that we will live up to your expectations.&rdquo;The bank said it was in a strong financial position and well within the statutory requirements as governed by Central Bank of Kenya, &ldquo;a fact that is easily confirmed through the return that we make as required by law.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;We thank our customers who have stood by us despite the negative messages going round and urge them to continue supporting the bank,&rdquo; a statement published in media said.Family Bank is the second lender to battle such rumours in the past week alone.Last week, the officers from DCI launched investigations into the origin of a post on social media that indicated that Prime Bank was not stable and advised the customers to withdraw their money.The bank too denied the reports and also lodged a complaint with the BFIU. Iregi said they are still investigating the issue.Officers say the motive of the messages is yet to be known and indicated preliminary findings show a case of fun taken too far.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t rule out competition but this seems to be out of joke and fun which was taken far. It will be expensive for many,&rdquo; said an officer aware of the probe.The banking industry is shaky in the wake of probe by agencies into the manner in which National Youth Service money was swindled through the ministry of devolution. Billions of money was passed through at least 28 banks which are now under probe and risk fines and other forms of punishment. More than Sh10 billion was swindled through the banks, the Parliamentary Accounts Committee has found out.PAC has since asked DCI and EACC to probe all the transactions in the banks without favour or fear amid concerns there were skewed probes by the agencies.
