ODM leader Raila Odinga yesterday blasted the Jubilee government for failing to curb insecurity.In a scathing attack, Raila dismissed the Jubilee leadership as lacking the mandate to rule the country any more.The former Prime Minister, who led a number of ODM MPs on a tour of the volatile Kerio Valley region, said the Government had failed to discharge its constitutional mandate. He asked Kenyans to come out in large numbers and vote it out in next year&#39;s General Election. Speaking at Chesogoch Primary School in Marakwet East sub-county, which has witnessed an upsurge of cattle rustling, Raila said security is the main role of any Government the world over.&quot;It is a pity that criminal elements across the country continue to reign terror while the Government sits as innocent Kenyans continue to lose their lives and property. There is no need for such a government to continue being in power,&quot; he said.He said Jubilee had lost focus in discharging its constitutional duties noting that President Uhuru Kenyatta had failed Kenyans in many sectors.Referring to the recent visit by Deputy President William Ruto to the region where a day later raiders staged another daring attack, Raila said; &quot;The criminal elements know very well of the dysfunctional government and it is a clear demonstration that the Government of the day is not in a position to protect the lives and property of her citizens.&quot;Raila tore into the local leadership and challenged it to resign if it cannot protect residents against acts of lawlessness.&quot;I was dismayed by one of the leaders from Jubilee government for saying he was tired of burying his people every weekend. He should resign forthwith together with other leaders since it is evident that the government they serve is unable to handle issues affecting their people,&quot; he added.The Opposition leader said the Grand Coalition government had attempted to address the cattle rustling menace saying he visited the area in 2001 during the infamous Murkutwo massacre where 67 people were killed.&quot;What is going on in Marakwet should not be happening in a post-independence Kenya. The issue of cattle rustling is undermining development gains, which we initiated during the Grand Coalition government and most of them have stalled including the road network,&quot; he said.Residents hailed the CORD leader for visiting the area during their hour of need and warned the Jubilee administration, saying they will not vote for it next year.&quot;Jubilee has rewarded our 99.9 votes with utter neglect and loss of lives,&quot; said William Kipruto, a resident.
