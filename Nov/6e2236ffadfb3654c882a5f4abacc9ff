Governor Samuel Tunai has called for the use of alternative mechanisms to resolve domestic disputes in the county as opposed to the courts. Mr Tunai, who spoke after members of the National Gender Commission visited him in his office, told the agency to consider involving village elders in dispute resolution.&quot;The court system is sometimes tedious and expensive. However, I believe if we sensitised elders in the counties, most of these cases could be resolved at village level,&quot; said Tunai.&quot;Involving lawyers in domestic matters is not always the right way to go. It is an expensive process and the judgement might also take a long time before it is delivered,&quot; he said.&quot;Each county has its own unique cultural demands and the commission should adopt its strategy depending on the county in order to effectively root out gender-based violence. I don&#39;t believe people should use culture as an excuse to propagate gender violence; it is wrong and we must all condemn it.&quot;Tunai also wants the commission to use the local language in disseminating messages against gender violence.&quot;Women in the village will only understand gender equality when it is spoken in a familiar language and preferably through local leaders that they respect. I believe every culture advocates for the respect of women and children, and it is not permitted anywhere for a man to beat his wife or vice versa.&quot;Saro Katelo, the National Gender Commission&#39;s director of corporate services, said: &quot;We believe the only way Kenyans can understand gender-based violence and its dangers is by using leaders that locals look up to and respect.&quot;Katelo said the commission was also working with counties to sensitise Kenyans on their activities.&quot;The commission will partner with the various counties to advance the cause of gender equality and inclusion. We want to partner with the leaders of all 47 counties so we can succeed in our activities.&quot;
