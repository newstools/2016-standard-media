Early voting which kicked off over a month ago closed on Saturday evening with huge turnouts especially in the swing vote States.But interesting to note is the high numbers of Latinos who have cast their ballot even as Republican nominee Donald Trump edged closer to Democratic&#39;s Hillary Clinton in the race for the Oval office the culminates on Tuesday.The latest polls show that Clinton was at 46 per cent, just three points ahead of Trump, whose candidature is facing a major challenge from the Latinos. With over 33 million early voters having cast their ballot by Friday, it is projected that about 60 per cent, might have voted.Trump and Clinton crossed the battleground States as traditional map shift shows some change in the blue or red States. Trump was in Ohio and Nevada while Clinton was in Florida and Philadelphia.In New Hampshire for instance, Clinton has 12,000 volunteers in 60 locations making last-minute efforts to encourage people to get out and vote. Trump&#39;s campaign has 1.4 million volunteers and has reached 1.3 million voters.In Virginia State, both at Hampton and Newport News, absentee and curbside voters turned up in their thousands, including 101-year-old Thelma Feaster, who said she had to be part of the history making process.Feaster sat patiently in the car as a relative, Cassandar Hamilton, sought out the City Registrar Office to help her vote without queuing.&quot;It will be crowded on Tuesday and we must get people to White House to take care of business. This campaign is crazy. I have voted for Hillary and I hope she wins,&quot; said Feaster, who said she has been voting for over 20 years now.&quot;If Trump wins, I guess I will pack my bag. Everybody must vote, if you don&#39;t vote, you are just striving,&quot; said&nbsp;Feaster.Hamilton said voting, as a right in America, has been a struggle since the 1960s and emphasised the need for everybody to vote.&quot;It is the duty of every citizen to vote. If you don&#39;t vote, you can&#39;t complain. Not voting is a bad choice. Let us vote because this is our government and our responsibility,&quot; said Hamilton who supports Clinton.Feaster called on Americans to vote in a candidate who is going to continue to push the country forward.When The Standard contacted the Hampton City Registrar Tera Morgan, she said they haad 6,345 absentee paper ballot.She said the exercise was smooth with no security or technical hitches. &quot;We were adequately prepared to handle the situation. It is a normal exercise with security on standby. The numbers could be close to the 2012 election which stood at 7,340 while in 2008, the turnout was higher at 9,800,&quot; said Morgan.She continued: &quot;The exercise kicked off on September 23. It has been a pleasant exercise with not so long queues. We are assisting the curbside voters.&quot;Some of Clinton&#39;s supporters who spoke to The Standard after casting their votes exuded confidence that she will win.&quot;We go democratic all the way,&quot; Mamie Davis said after voting at Hampton absentee voting center.Others including Shantel Williams and Janet Anderson lauded the electoral process, saying it is very fast. However, they said they are praying that the outcome does not polarize the country the same way the campaigns have done.By Saturday afternoon, there was a long queue of voters at Hampton&#39;s Voter Registrar&#39;s Office and the situation was not different at Newport News voting center.Copland Bedward said: &quot;It is only through voting that citizens can voice their concerns and if they don&#39;t, there&#39;s not room for complains.&quot;&quot;Hopefully Clinton will win. Both Clinton and Trump are not the best candidates but it&#39;s better to choose the lesser of the two evils. I don&#39;t necessarily agree with Clinton&#39;s policies but she is better placed to move the country forward,&quot; he said.
