African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has requested for close to 9,000 more soldiers to facilitate its operations. This request has come with a stern warning to the political elite against using&nbsp;their contribution to Somalia as a bargaining power to table their demands. &quot;States should not use AMISOM&nbsp;troops as a bargaining power to seek compliance on their demands,&quot; said the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission for Somalia (SRCC) Ambassador Fransisco Madeira. He added,&nbsp;&quot;These soldiers give so much including their lives. It is better to find other avenues to pile pressure on but not AMISOM&nbsp;soldiers.&quot; It is barely a week since Kenya started withdrawing her slightly over 1,000 soldiers out of rage from South Sudan after the United Nations fired Lt Johnson Ondieki as the peacekeeping army commander for allegedly not protecting civilians as indicated in a report that criticised his leadership. Ahead of the October 2018 exit plan, Madeira said despite their ongoing peacekeeping efforts, they face a serious lack of logistics support.

South Sudan mission South Sudan urges UN to reconsider Gen Ondieki&rsquo;s dismissal This is on the side of Somali&#39;s army that now stands at about 10,900.&nbsp; &quot;But we need to have at least 20,000 to ensure the country&#39;s army is equipped fully ahead of the exit. This is exactly where the problem is.&quot; Madeira asked for the United Nations to consider equipping the Somali soldiers who are being trained by AMISOM countries. He further asked for facilitation of firearms and other armories to Somalia&#39;s army. &quot;We are training the Somali soldiers but you see, a soldier becomes one when he has a gun to fight. But there is fear that Somali is full of guns hence the hesitation,&quot; said Madeira. Madeira said through the training, they have already certified the Somali troops to fight alongside AMISOM&nbsp;but they lack firearms. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
