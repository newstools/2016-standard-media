The Constitution of Kenya should be amended to give the President more powers to fight graft, Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki has said. Speaking at Gatunga, in Tharaka constituency on Saturday, Kindiki said some clauses in the new constitution have compromised President&rsquo;s Powers to act directly on challenges facing his administration including fight on corruption. Further, the Tharaka-Nithi senator blamed the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission and the Judiciary for delaying in investigating and prosecuting senior government officials implicated in graft. &ldquo;It is very unfortunate that the President has no direct hand in punishing the officials implicated in corruption, the bodies that have been given mandate seems to be reluctant in investigating and prosecuting the graft officials,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We shall lobby and ensure the constitution is amended to give the president powers to handle corruption in the ministries directly,&rdquo; he added. Kindiki said Uhuru Kenyatta is committed to restore confidence of Kenyans in various ministries by fighting corrupt officials, recalling that he acted and sacked Cabinet Secretaries Charity Ngilu, Michael Kamau, and Ann Waiguru among others when they were adversely mentioned in graft allegations.
