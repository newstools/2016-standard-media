Most five and four star hotels in Kenya trace their origin from abroad. The tide has, however, started shifting with local entrepreneurs putting their money into the hospitality industry as they seek to reap big from the budding sector.The latest entrant into this lucrative club of the hospitality industry is the Amber Hotel, located along Ngong Road. According to Elisha Katam, the general manager, there is a growing gap for these kinds of hotels offering local entrepreneurs enormous investment opportunities and the public affordable facilities with international standards.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are out to end the speculation that local people cannot afford to enjoy the facilities in the hospitality industry,&rdquo; explains Katam.Amber Hotel is rated as a contemporary four-star hotel in Nairobi with a unique architectural style, elegant decor, personalized service and affordable top quality facilities suited for accommodation, meeting, leisure and culinary needs. The hotel stands as a landmark along Ngong Lane off Ngong Road.It has a capacity of 109 air-conditioned rooms, which are tastefully designed to provide comfort, convenience and efficiency supported by the latest in technology.All the rooms feature flat screen TVs, complimentary high-speed internet access, a mini bar, in-room safe deposit facility, tea/coffee&nbsp;&nbsp; making facilities, direct dial international telephones, hair dryers and ironing board on request.&ldquo;In this new age, competition is high so we need to satisfy our customers by offering&nbsp;&nbsp; what others are not,&rdquo; he notes.The facility boasts of four state-o- the-art air conditioned conference and meeting rooms with natural daylight.The largest meeting room caters for up to 250 people theater style and can be adapted to suit specific meetings and events&rsquo; needs.&nbsp;&ldquo;The hotel industry, which is a service industry has become globally competitive due to destination growth and that&rsquo;s why we must invest heavily in our facilities to ensure that we meet the standards of the customers,&rdquo;explains Katam.In addition, all rooms feature &nbsp;&nbsp;modern audio visual equipment, high-speed internet access, a business center, and an outdoor venue adequate for corporate events.As globalization creates competition in every sector of the economy, the tourism sector, which is strongly linked with the hospitality sector, is one of the industries which have been strongly affected. Thus with the increasing competition rises the need for strategies to create a competitive edge in the hospitality industry.
