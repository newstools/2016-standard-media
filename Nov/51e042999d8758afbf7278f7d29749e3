The county government has begun a process that will see land rate defaulters lose their property. Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s government is owed&nbsp;Sh14 billion in unpaid land rates that have accrued for years. This is enough to run the county smoothly for two years.&nbsp;Mombasa gets about Sh5.7 billion a year in equitable share from the Exchequer. To recover this debt, the county will take over ownership of 426 units of prime property, some of which are located in the central business district. Some of the targeted buildings are TSS Towers on Nkrumah Road and Splendid Hotel on Msanifu Kombo Road where notices were placed warning of the impending takeover. TSS Towers is owned by business mogul Twahir Sheikh, whose empire is embroiled in multi-faceted legal battles involving his children and bankers. County Lands Executive Antony Njaramba confirmed the notices placed on prime properties - mainly land - across the county as part of the recovery process.

We have so far recovered Sh50 million in the process,&rdquo; Mr Njaramba said yesterday. Biggest Defaulters He added that the clamping began two weeks ago and would go on until they recovered the outstanding rates. &ldquo;The notices express our intention to take over management of the buildings. The owners can still rush and pay,&rdquo; he explained. The county placed the notices on the affected buildings but they were immediately removed by unknown people. National government institutions, ministries and installations are the biggest defaulters. They collectively owe the county government Sh6 billion in land rates. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
