Kenya is seeking the support of the African Union chairman, President Idriss D&eacute;by, over Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed&#39;s bid for the AU Commission chair. Speaking in N&#39;djamena, where he presented a special message from President Uhuru Kenyatta to President&nbsp;D&eacute;by of Chad, Deputy President William Ruto expressed confidence that President Idriss will use his wisdom and judgement in deciding what is best for Africa. He said Kenya believes that ambassador Amina has what it takes in terms of experience and knowledge to drive the African agenda forward. &nbsp;&quot;Ambassador Amina sits in the executive council of Africa Agenda 2063 and understands where we want to take Africa. We have a clear (picture) of the infrastructure, agriculture and peace that we believe Amina&#39;s leadership will help us achieve,&quot; said the Deputy President. &nbsp;TWO CANDIDATES Ruto said Kenya was well aware that Chad has nominated her long-serving Foreign Affairs Minister Moussa Faki Mahamat for the same position but hastened to add that Kenya believed Deby has two candidates, Moussa and Amina, and he will have one of them elected in January 2017.
