A man was arraigned in a Kitui court and charged with impersonating a Kenya Power employee, stealing, defrauding, and illegally connecting and disconnecting electricity. Senior Principal Magistrate Esther Boke granted David Makokha Nyongesa Sh300,000 bond with a surety of similar amount or Sh100,000 cash bail until May 29, 2017, when the case will commence hearing. Mr Nyongesa faced nine counts that included receiving Sh43,000 from a customer, Stephen Kimanzi, by pretending that he would replace two post-paid meters.
