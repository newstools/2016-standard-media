For 11 years, Harrison Murigi was on death row but never gave up the legal battle to prove his innocence. He was convicted for robbery with violence, a charge he persistently contested, insisting he was an accident victim mistaken by police for an armed robber in 2005.&nbsp; Yesterday, his hard-fought appeal paid off after High Court judge Hatari Waweru freed him, citing flawed prosecution. &ldquo;The appellant&rsquo;s convictions are entirely unsafe and cannot be allowed to stand. I will allow this appeal in its entirety; both convictions are quashed and the sentence of death set aside,&rdquo; ruled Justice Waweru. The Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko also admitted the man ought not to have been jailed as there was no evidence linking him to the offence. Twice, Murigi was tried at the magistrate&rsquo;s court and on the both occasions, was found guilty of the capital offence.
