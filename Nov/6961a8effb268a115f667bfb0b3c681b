&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} Washington:Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would have to &quot;see how things play out&quot; before accepting the election results, pointing to possible irregularities as he again warned of a rigged political system. Local media reported that voters in several counties in Pennsylvania had reported that touch-screen voting machines had not been recording their ballots correctly. &quot;We&#39;re going to see how things play out today. Hopefully they&#39;ll play out well and hopefully we won&#39;t have to worry about it, meaning hopefully we&#39;ll win,&quot; Trump said in a telephone interview on Fox News. &quot;I want to see everything honest.&quot; Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that rely on electronic voting machines without a paper backup that allows officials to double-check the outcome, if challenged. The machines can record votes incorrectly if they are not calibrated properly, a problem that is magnified as the screens degrade with age. The Pennsylvania Secretary of State&#39;s office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected Trump&#39;s request for records from the polling site. Nevada state law says voters who are in line when the polls close must be allowed to cast their ballots. At a court hearing in Las Vegas on Tuesday, a county attorney argued that election officials already preserve records.
