Traders and residents of Webuye town are upbeat ahead of the reopening of Pan Paper Mills mid this month. They said the factory, which collapsed in 2009, would improve trade while creating employment. &quot;It will improve cash flow and bring the town back to life. Youths have turned to crime but this will change as the factory opens,&quot; said businessman Daniel Wafula. Jane Maina, a resident, said news of the revival had renewed hopes of a better life. &quot;We are living at the mercy of criminal gangs because of unemployment but things will get better,&quot; she said.

It will be reopened by mid November, God willing, by President Uhuru Kenyatta,&quot; Mr Lusaka said when he toured the mill. The factory was to be reopened on August 30 but the new investor asked for more time to replace some machines. Last month, Rai Group of Companies General Manager Chowdarry Venkanna said they were ready for the reopening. Already, 200 former employees have been recalled. About 1,500 people will be employed once the factory is fully operational.
