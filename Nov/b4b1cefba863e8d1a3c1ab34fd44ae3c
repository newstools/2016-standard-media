Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i has threatened to withdraw charters of universities that graduate politicians who have not met academic thresholds. He said the institutions &ndash;public or private &ndash; found to have relaxed strict academic standards to enable politicians graduate will be punished. &quot;The government will not allow situations where politicians rush to learning institutions and graduate to enable them contest various seats,&quot; said Matiangi. He further put on notice universities and colleges offering &#39;funny&#39; programmes. &quot;Universities must tailor their programmes to meet economic needs of the country,&quot; he said during the graduation ceremony of Cooperative University. The warning comes months after Matiang&#39;i also put politicians with questionable papers on notice ahead of next year&#39;s General Elections. Speaking at a previous media breakfast meeting, Matiang&#39;i said no politician will be cleared to contest if the Commission for University Education (CUE) is not satisfied with the university papers presented. CUE is under firm instructions to scrutinise case by case to ensure only persons with valid and recognised papers will be cleared for next elections.
