Recent public endorsement of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga as CORD&#39;s 2017 presidential candidate has stirred unease within the coalition. A section of Wiper Party legislators accused ODM politicians of fuelling division in CORD. Reacting to latest remarks by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, who urged CORD co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&#39;ula to step down for ODM leader Raila Odinga in the race for the presidency, MPs allied to Kalonzo said the trend could cause &#39;irreparable damage&#39; in the opposition coalition. Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni), Wiper Party Organising Secretary Robert Mbui, Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo and an East African Legislative Assembly legislator Peter Mathuki yesterday hit out at ODM politicians who have been publicly endorsing Raila, terming the their pronouncements &#39;irresponsible and lacking in wisdom.&#39; The leaders said ODM politicians must exercise restraint in their pronouncements, and allow established organs in the coalition to handle the process of picking a presidential flag bearer. &quot;These are the comments that are creating discord. If everyone in Ford-Kenya and Wiper does the same we will have no coalition,&quot; said Mutula Jnr.

Mr Mathuki said ODM leaders&#39; public endorsement of Raila were eroding the unity in the opposition coalition. &quot;Joho was completely out of order in making such utterances as he is not a member of the CORD management board,&quot; he said. Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo accused the Jubilee administration of using Joho to split the Opposition. But Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama disagreed with his Wiper colleagues, saying it was normal for politicians to declare support for their party leaders. &quot;That is not different from what Wiper members have been telling Raila and Wetang&#39;ula,&quot; Muthama said in a text message to The Standard. Addressing journalists after a breakfast prayer meeting in Wote Makueni County on Monday, Kalonzo refused to comment on the subject.
