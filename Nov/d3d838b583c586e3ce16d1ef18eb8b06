A leadership row is simmering within Ford Kenya, with some members calling for the removal of party leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula.In a letter copied to Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&#39;u, a group led by Peter Munyae wants Senator Wetang&#39;ula replaced for failing to call a National Delegates Conference (NDC) since 2011.&quot;The party Constitution requires that you convene NDC at least once every two years. &quot;The last NDC was held in 2011 and no plausible reasons have been advanced by yourself, the National Executive Council or the party leader to explain this disregard of the party constitution,&quot; said the letter signed by Mr Munyae.He claimed to be the duly elected Ford-K national organising secretary.In a rejoinder, Wetang&#39;ula termed Munyae a stranger in the party, saying he had been relieved of his position two years ago and replaced by other officials.
