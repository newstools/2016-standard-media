The Government has built a police post in Songhor West along the clash-prone Kisumu-Nandi border. The establishment of the police post follows an outcry from residents regarding frequent clashes between communities living along the border. The conflicts in Muhoroni, Songhor, Miwani, Chemelil and Nandi-Kipsigis has been a sore point for years, with fresh attacks emerging during election periods. A few months ago, more than three people were killed and hundreds injured amid reports that raiders who had torched houses faced little resistance because the police were caught flat-footed. The protests forced security bosses to deploy more than 400 police officers to the region to patrol the border and help quell the violence. Over 500 families were displaced as a result of the skirmishes. During musician Achieng Abura&#39;s funeral , Nyando MP Fred Outa and Kisumu Woman Rep Rose Nyamunga called for peaceful co-existence among the two communities.
