Security officers have been accused of contributing to the rise in drug abuse at the coast. Yesterday, residents of Lamu town, Mpeketoni&nbsp;and Pate Island told the Kenya National Commission&nbsp;on Human Rights (KNCHR) that drug lords use&nbsp;boats and collude with police to facilitate the illicit&nbsp;trade. They said the campaign against drug abuse in&nbsp;Lamu County had been paralysed after its chief crusader&nbsp;quit because he was frequently harassed by&nbsp;police. Sheikh Said Ali said he resigned in 2012 when he&nbsp;realised that police were colluded with drug traffickers&nbsp;to fight the community policing team.

Sheikh Said Ali, alias Baskuti, said he resigned from the fight in 2012 when&nbsp;police&nbsp;colluded with&nbsp;drug&nbsp;traffickers&nbsp;and fought the community&nbsp;policing&nbsp;team against the trade that he led. Ali&nbsp;told&nbsp;KNCHR&nbsp;commissioners that&nbsp;police&nbsp;fabricated four cases of assault that got him a three-year non-custodial sentence. He said before that he was threatened, his hand broken and house torched for going against&nbsp;police&nbsp;officers&nbsp;protecting&nbsp;traffickers&nbsp;on Lamu Island where a wave of crime has been rampant following the growing number of addicts. &quot;I have suffered a lot in the hands of&nbsp;police&nbsp;officers&nbsp;protecting&nbsp;drug&nbsp;barons on Lamu Island and I still live in fear. I decided to quit the crusade in 2012 and now&nbsp;drug&nbsp;trafficking&nbsp;is thriving,&quot; Ali said. Following the revelation,&nbsp;KNCHR&nbsp;chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori called for a private meeting with Sheikh Ali to plan how corrupt officers could be brought to book so that the community-led anti-drug&nbsp;war could resume.
