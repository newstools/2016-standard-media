The Ministry of Education will change strategies employed to curb examination cheating in subsequent years. &nbsp;Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang &nbsp;said the strategies would likely shift from strict supervision as experienced this year to streamlining of the general examination system. &nbsp;&ldquo;We have learned a lot from this year&rsquo;s supervision experience. We need to sustain the momentum by all of us playing our roles as expected, then there will be no more supervision as this one,&rdquo; he said. Speaking at St. &nbsp;Mathias Boys High School in Busia County during examination supervision, Mr Kipsang said there was need for general sanity to be restored in the country&rsquo;s education sector. Kipsang added that this year&rsquo;s examinations had experienced highest integrity that will give Kenyan education competitiveness globally. &ldquo;Just like during war, every other moment has its own strategy and strict supervision was our strategy this year,&rdquo; he added.
