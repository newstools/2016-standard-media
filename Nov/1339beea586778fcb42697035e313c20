The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leaders now want office of the Deputy President William Ruto investigated on National Youth Service scam. The party national chairman John Mbadi said there is suspicion that somebody in Ruto&#39;s office was involved in loss of the millions of shillings. Speaking to journalists on phone, Mbadi said the manner in which Ruto is engaged in squabbles with former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru shows some of his close allies were also involved in the scandal. &quot;Ruto has been quiet before Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Faruk Kibet were adversely mentioned in the scandal. But he began getting annoyed after the two were mentioned hence his office should be investigated too,&quot; said Mbadi. Mbadi told Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo who chairs Parliamentary Accounts Committee to ensure that Ruto&#39;s office is investigated thoroughly. &quot;This scandal is bigger than Waiguru alone and anybody who demonstrates suspicion should be investigated effectively because it is evident Kenyans lost extremely large amount of money in the NYS scandal,&quot; added Mbadi.

Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma said that Ruto&#39;s exchange with Waiguru demonstrated that Jubilee was not ready to fight corruption effectively &quot;We need a Government which can fight corruption. Ruto and Waiguru&#39;s exchange of words is a failure by the Jubilee administration to fight corruption in this country,&quot; said Mr Kaluma.
