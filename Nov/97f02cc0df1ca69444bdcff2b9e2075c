Czech scientists have developed a model of a functioning human lung that can be used to simulate problems like asthma or other chronic diseases and their treatments.The research group from the Brno University of Technology says its mechanical- and computer-based model of the lung can help devise treatment methods with more precision than past testing and tailor it to individual patients.It can also be used as a reference model for developing inhaled drugs. &quot;This model will show whether an inhaled drug will settle in the concrete areas where we need it to,&quot; said Miroslav Jicha, the head of the research team.The team see the model - developed using 3D printing and other technologies - becoming the European standard for testing. It has received three patents for its modeling.
