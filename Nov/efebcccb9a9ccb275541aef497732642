Medics say victims are in a stable condition. Murang&rsquo;a County Health Chief Officer Joseph Mbai warned locals against eating meat from unknown sources. Mr Mbai said the man who distributed the meat has since gone into hiding. Public health officers, he said, had been mobilised to conduct health education in Karurumo and neighbouring villages, urging those who could have eaten the meat to seek treatment. &ldquo;The suspect is presently at large but in future the locals must exercise a lot of caution to ensure they buy meat from licensed outlets to avoid catching diseases,&rdquo; he said.
