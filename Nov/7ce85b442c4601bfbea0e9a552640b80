Lurambi constituents are up in arms over stalled multi-million-shilling projects in the area initiated using constituency fund cash. The Constituency Development Fund (CDF) has been renamed the National Government Constituencies Development Fund. Led by Alex Mutende, they cited an abandoned CDF office building after area MP Raphael Otaalo opted to set up new offices at Eshiru trading centre, about five kilometres away. &quot;Millions of shillings were sunk into the CDF office at the expense of other key projects that could have assisted the people, particularly needy students,&quot; said Mr Mutende. The constituents demanded a thorough audit of all CDF projects initiated since 2008. &quot;We want to know why a lot of money was used to start many projects, most of which were abandoned without any explanation by our former and present legislators,&quot; said Mutende.

In a rejoinder, Otaalo said Sh170 million was required to complete the CDF office building in Kakamega town. &quot;Before I took over, my predecessor (Manyala Keya) had used Sh54 million on the said building but we could not complete it after Lurambi was split into two since the CDF allocation then reduced drastically.&quot; The MP disclosed that plans were under way to have the building in Kakamega town surrendered to the county government. &quot;We expect the county to complete the building and utilise it in future,&quot; said Otaalo. He urged area residents to elect leaders based on their track records. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
