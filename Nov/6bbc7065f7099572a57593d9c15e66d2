Cord is now claiming retired IEBC commissioners are still running affairs and frustrating new electoral laws. &nbsp; &ldquo;We are aware that the Secretariat and some of the retired Commissioners have been holding informal meetings with the Deputy President and the Cabinet Secretary responsible for ICT to block the full and comprehensive implementation of the Election Laws (Amendment) Act 2016, including exerting inappropriate influence on the nomination of the new Commissioners,&rdquo; CORD said in a press statement. CORD says IEBC under an unconstitutional, illegal and a mysterious hand has done everything to replicate the flaws, malpractices and fraud committed in previous elections. &ldquo;The new legal regime demands that an exhaustive audit of the register be carried out based on the mandatory requirement that each voters biometrics must be captured in the register for purposes of verification and ultimately to secure the accuracy of the register.&nbsp; The IEBC intends to engage a disreputed firm to carry out a random inspection of the register for purposes of a misplaced exercise in public relations.&rdquo; The IEBC Secretariat has drafted regulations purportedly in an effort to implement the integrated use of technology which in effect downplay, water down and emasculate the stringent conditions set out in the Act, in order to avoid oversight by relevant agencies, institutions, stakeholders and political parties, including oversight over the transparent acquisition and disposal of assets and systems for the elections. &ldquo;IEBC is constantly and persistently, but with a degree of subtlety, making a case for the postponement of the next general elections and for the extension of the life of parliament and the tenure of the President.&rdquo; READ MORE Ford Kenya wants CORD to share elective posts Jubilee Party's campaign team holds meeting to discuss nominations Raila in fresh bid to reclaim Rift Valley support, endorses Kimaiyo &ldquo;The Secretariat has now deviously developed opportunities for a second &ldquo;chickengate&rdquo; harvest of colossal sums of tax money through questionable procurement of assets and equipment for next year&rsquo;s general elections.&nbsp; It should be remembered that it is the Secretariat that executed the chickengate scandals whose forbidden fruits were shared between elements in the staff and some of the retired Commissioners.&nbsp; IEBC is demanding billions of shillings for the conduct of the elections but are vehemently opposed to necessary oversight in accordance with the constitutional principles for the electoral system that include, transparency, impartiality, efficiency, accuracy and accountability.&rdquo; &ldquo;There will be no election unless the entire legal regime, including the use of technology in an integrated electronic electoral system, is fully implemented and the conduct of free and fair elections is guaranteed.&rdquo;
