Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has faulted plans to amend the Energy Bill to slash benefits for locals from oil exploration.The original Bill proposes that the county government where oil is being explored gets at least 20 per cent of proceeds and another 10 per cent sent directly to residents, according to the senator. Gideon, who is also the chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy, said the planned changes to the Bill are against the wishes of most Kenyans.The senator who noted the Government is planning to reduce the percentage of benefits that goes to the host county government by five per cent, has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to maintain the Bill as it is.&quot;It was out of goodwill that the Senate Committee on Energy recommended that the locals should benefit from exploration of oil. We want the exploration to benefit the locals where the natural resources are explored,&quot; said Moi.Gideon called on senators to help protect Kenyans from being shortchanged by the Government in sharing of oil proceeds &quot;by persuading President Kenyatta against making any changes to the Energy Bill&quot;.&quot;I ask my fellow senators to stand with me and let us prevail upon the President to reconsider his decision. It will be unfair for locals to be denied their right to benefit from the proceeds of exploration,&quot; said the senator who is also Kanu chairman.He was speaking during the funeral of former Kanu leader Sarah Jemutai Saina in Mosop, Nandi County on Saturday.The funeral was also attended by ODM leader Raila Odinga, Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and Cleophas Lagat (Nandi) and Nandi Senator Stephen Sang.MPs Junet Mohamed (Suna), Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), Elijah Lagat (Chesumei) and Zipporah Kering (Nandi woman representative) were also present.Oil exploration in Kenya has been an emotive issue with local communities demanding their fair share of proceeds and jobs.London-listed Tullow Oil for instance, has had to suspend drilling operations in the past due to security concerns, after local residents held protests demanding more jobs at the exploration sites.
