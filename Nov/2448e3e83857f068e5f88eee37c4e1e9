The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Morocco&nbsp;and other partners have launched three new initiatives to step up climate change action in agriculture.The initiatives &mdash; Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA), Global Framework on Water Scarcity and the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Morocco are designed to assist small-scale farmers cope in the wake of climate change. They were launched at Action Event, which aims to boost concerted efforts by the public and private sectors to cut emissions rapidly, help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build a sustainable future.Most countries consider agriculture among their adaptation or mitigation priorities to help limit global temperature rise, in line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement.Practices such as use of nitrogen-efficient and heat-tolerant crop varieties, improved water harvesting, zero-tillage and sustainable soil management lead to improvements in food security as well as resilience to climate change.

Our people shouldn&rsquo;t be dying when we have rain. Let Government take this initiatives seriously and help alleviate human suffering,&rdquo; Mithika said.The high-level climate talks come to an end this week.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Kenya calls for support, vows to sustain global warming fight
