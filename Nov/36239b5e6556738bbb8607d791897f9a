A Sh200 million hotel will be constructed on the 20-acre Njuri Ncheke shrine in Tigania West. Secretary General Josphat Murangiri said the complex, which will comprise a cultural centre (museum) and a youth resource centre, will be a replica of the Bomas of Kenya. The development is part of an ambitious project by the Njuri Ncheke Supreme Council to have a source of income for its community development programmes, including eradication of Female Genital Mutilation and supporting youth and women groups in enterprise development. Members in all the sub-counties of Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties will contribute to lay the foundation next year.
