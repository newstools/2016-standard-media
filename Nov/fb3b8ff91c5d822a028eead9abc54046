The National Assembly&rsquo;s Committee on Agriculture has been asked to disband the board and management of Mumias Sugar Company. Cane farmers led by their representative Boniface Manda told the 12 members of the House committee to move fast and salvage the company. Mr Manda, who read the farmers&rsquo; resolutions, accused Mumias Sugar Company of failing to give priority to cane growers. Mumias Sugar Company posted a Sh4.73 billion loss for the year ended June 2016. &ldquo;Farmers want the current chairman to resign and have resolved that the company should have a new management, which should be less in number,&rdquo; Manda said. The farmers also want the miller to be paying farmers within a week after cane delivery and to give growers seed varieties that mature within 12 months.

And speaking to The Standard, Bishop Beneah Salala of ACK Mumias Diocese accused the parliamentary committee of failing to give priority to farmers. He said the committee was only interested in getting allowances instead of addressing the farmers&rsquo; grievances. Committee chairman Kipsang Kemei assured farmers their grievances would be addressed within two weeks. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
