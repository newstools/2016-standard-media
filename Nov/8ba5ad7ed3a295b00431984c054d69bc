Banks cannot withhold customers&rsquo; money or debit their accounts in instances of suspected fraud, the High Court has ruled.High Court Judge Patrick Otieno said banks cannot claim what is kept in customers&rsquo; accounts, unless there is a contract between them that states they can do so.He made the ruling in a case where a customer had filed a suit against Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), claiming the lender had frozen his accounts without proof of wrongdoing. The judge said if banks were allowed to ransack their clients&rsquo; accounts, freeze them and debit the amount claimed to have been lost, without being questioned, it would amount to anarchy.Credit balanceThe judge said a client&rsquo;s money does not belong to the bank.&ldquo;My understanding of the bank-customer relationship is that so long as there is a credit balance in the account, the customer has the right to access and withdraw it at will, unless there is a contract to the contrary,&rdquo; Justice Otieno said.&ldquo;As it were, the bank merely keeps the money safe on behalf of the customer. It has no right or indeed any claim over the property in the money.&ldquo;The money simply doesn&rsquo;t belong to it to deal with it as it pleases. That to me is all the trial court found in the judgement challenged before me. I find no fault with the trial court, with the analysis of evidence, and the decision reached, and to that extent, I find that the appeal is unmerited.&rdquo;The magistrate&rsquo;s court case against KCB was filed by Bryceson Kuboka, who operated Airport African Restaurant in 2014.However, the bank, in its defence, argued it withheld Sh1.5 million from Mr Kuboka&rsquo;s account after a routine review revealed there had been fraudulent Visa and MasterCard transactions for which the bank was charged Sh3.4 million.The lender said it had the right under its agreement with the customer to debit the account on discovery that some receipts or vouchers were invalid, or if the cardholder makes claim against the bank.The magistrate dismissed KCB&rsquo;s argument, saying there was no justification for freezing the account.On appeal, KCB asked the High Court to find that there was fraud and it had the right to recover its share of losses from the account.Otieno, however, found that the lower court erred by allowing Kuboka to tabulate the amount of money he had lost due to the freeze after the magistrate made a final judgement.The judge said the court went out of its way to get additional evidence after the case had been concluded, without guidelines on how the bank would respond to the same.
