A tiny metallic meteorite dubbed the &quot;Egg Rock&quot; has been found on Mars, triggering hopes the red planet could home to nickel deposits.NASA&rsquo;s Mars Curiosity Rover is said to have captured a photograph of the rock on October 31.The meteorite is thought to be made of nickel iron, according to an analysis by researchers, RT reports.The find comes after the Mars Curiosity Rover photographed a mysterious snaked-shaped object on the Red Planet in September.Mars, which is close to an asteroid belt, is often the site of meteorite discoveries.It is believed the &quot;Egg Rock&quot; meteorite could have become molten as it entered the planet&#39;s atmosphere before hardening again because of the smoothness of its surface and deep grooves, the website said.Curiosity had found its first iron meteorite two years ago after landing on the planet for the mission in 2012.The discovery, named Lebanon, was 2 metres wide - much bigger than the &quot;Egg Rock&quot;.The earlier discovery of the snake-shaped object could be seen between rocks on the martian surface in high-resolution pictures released by NASA.Zooming in on the image appears to show the &quot;anomaly&quot; between slabs of stone.It tapers like a real snake and closer analysis reveals what appears to be the creature&#39;s head.Hundreds of conspiracy theorists have speculated that the creature could be an &quot;alien&quot; and some have taken to the video&#39;s comments section to point out a &quot;tentacle&quot; that can apparently be seen.
