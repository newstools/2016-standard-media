New-found political ally of Meru Governor Peter Munya has lost his State job. Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery revoked the appointment of Sheikh Juma Ngao as member of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Authority board. The revocation comes weeks after he was elected Party of National Unity vice chairman during a party convention at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi. Ngao&rsquo;s appointment was revoked alongside that of his colleague Nasieku Taraiya. The two were replaced by Margaret Moitallel and Farida Rashid. The revocations and appointments were contained in Friday&rsquo;s copy of the Kenya Gazette.
