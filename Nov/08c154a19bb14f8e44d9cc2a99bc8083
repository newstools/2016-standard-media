Blackish grey smoke hung in the air east of the Islamists&#39; stronghold and the regular sound of outgoing artillery fire could be heard, said a Reuters reporter near Bazwaia, about five km (three miles) east of Mosul. Explosions could be heard further east. &quot;We are currently fighting battles on the eastern outskirts of Mosul,&quot; Lieutenant-General Abdul Wahab al-Saidi of the elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) said. &quot;The pressure is on all sides of the city to facilitate entry to the city center.&quot; READ MORE 57 army recruits arrested over fake admission letters Iraqi forces make first push into Mosul Exclusive: U.S. stopped Philippines rifle sale that senator opposed - sources Two weeks after Iraqi forces, backed by extensive U.S.-led ground and air support, launched their campaign to retake Mosul from Islamic State, they have cleared scores of villages and towns on the Nineveh plain east of the city and are advancing along the Tigris river from the south.

The offensive, involving regular army forces, elite counter terrorism units, federal police, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and Shi&#39;ite militias, is the most complex since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein. Commanders have warned the fighting could last for months. &nbsp; WARNINGS OF POSSIBLE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
