Trencin, Slovakia: Two brothers from Slovakia won a grave-digging competition at an international exhibition of funeral, burial and cremation services on Thursday. Ladislav and Csaba Skladan, aged 43 and 41 respectively, dug a grave 1.5 meters deep, two meters long and 90 centimeters wide in 54 minutes in the western Slovak town of Trencin, beating 10 other two-member teams from Slovakia, Poland and Hungary as a small audience cheered loudly. Their grave was also the neatest, a five-member jury agreed. &quot;We want to show and appreciate the hard work of grave diggers,&quot; said Ladislav Striz, who established the contest last year. &quot;Most Slovak graveyards are so crowded and spaces between graves so narrow that we need human diggers instead of machines,&quot; he said. &quot;They work hard, come rain, come snow.&quot; &quot;I am happy we won, it&#39;s a satisfaction after fifteen years in this job,&quot; Csaba Skladan said. I had to focus on speed today but usually, when the weather is nice and I can chat with my brother, it&#39;s a dream job,&quot; added Ladislav Skladan.
