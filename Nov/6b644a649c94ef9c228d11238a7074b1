&nbsp;CORD leader Raila Odinga has said he will not be stopped from condemning corrupt cartels in the Jubilee Government.Raila said despite criticism from political forces in Jubilee seeking to undermine his quest for transparency and accountability, he will not relent in unearthing the rot in Government. He said that many political forces were banking on cheap propaganda to gain political mileage while tarnishing his name.&quot;I will not be cowed into relenting against condemning vices such as corruption that has polluted the country. It is my duty to raise such concerns,&quot; Raila said.Speaking during a funeral of former KANU leader Sarah Jemutai Saina, Raila said he was now shifting focus to politics of environmental protection adding that the country cannot be turned into a desert as he watches.&quot;The truth will set me free. I know what is happening and I will continue revealing because Kenyans have entrusted me with that responsibility,&quot; he said only a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta made a scathing attack on him over his continued utterances on corruption in the Government.The former premier said that he was leading other like-minded leaders who were concerned with preservation of forests saying that there was a need to prevent future adversities.&quot;I have said often that corruption has led to projects that will ultimately destroy our future. We shall pay for neglecting environmental issues. I will not be quiet where such issues are evident,&quot; he said.Raila also distanced himself from accusations that he had a hand in the predicaments that took Deputy President to The Hague court saying that William Ruto was his political partner.He posed, &quot;Am I mad to set Ruto yet he was on my side?&quot; adding that such claims had been used to deny him Rift Valley votes.&quot;Voting is a democratic right and people choose the candidate of their preference but making false claims against someone is not right,&quot; he said.Speaking at the burial ceremony Baringo Senator Gideon Moi also echoed similar concerns of divisive politics saying that a false claim that he is dividing Kalenjins was misleading adding that he will also condemn corruption in government.Moi said that he was not against Ruto&#39;s bid for presidency adding that before then every leader can chose to serve people in different ways.&quot;2022 is still a long time. Now we can serve Kenyans in different ways. Then later you can decide to support Ruto, myself or another person,&quot; Moi said amid cheers from mourners.&quot;Even when cattle rustling occurred in Kerio Valley, some people began to mention me. I don&#39;t understand such politics,&quot; he said.Others who were present the at ceremony include Governors Cleophas Lagat of Nandi and his Uasin Gishu counterpart Jackson Mandago, Nandi Senator Stephen Sang and several MPs from the region.
