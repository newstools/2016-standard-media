A director of a school in Nakuru says children of the former politician Kihika Kimani stole his goods valued at Sh19 million. Lawrence Karani, the Director of Kenya School of Sports and Talent while presenting his case before chief magistrate Josephat Kalo at a Nakuru Court, claimed that Caroline Wanjiku Kihika, Anthony Kihika and Catherine Wanjiru stole goods from his office on the night of January 13, 2016. &quot;The first accused person (Caroline Wanjiku) was arrested by security guards. She was in the company of another man who ran away. They had broken into the school and stole various assorted office goods,&quot; Karani said. He added that at the time of the incident, he had been evicted by Anthony on allegations that he had not paid Sh2.3 million rent for the lease of the premises to run the school. He refuted these claims and told the court that the three were not the right persons to ask for rent. &quot;I signed an agreement with the accused person&#39;s mothers and they had nothing to do with the property so they couldn&#39;t ask for the alleged rent as I was answerable to their parents,&quot; he said.
