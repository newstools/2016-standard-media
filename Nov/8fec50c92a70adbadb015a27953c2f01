Issac Muasa decided to give up his life of crime on Kenya&#39;s streets in the instant he saw a speeding police car aim for him and his friends as they tried to snatch a woman&#39;s purse. &quot;It was God who saved us (from the police) because we just ran very fast,&quot; said Muasa, 33, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. &quot;We almost died.&quot; Not long before, the bullet-ridden corpses of three of Muasa&#39;s friends had been found in a forest after they had left Mathare, Nairobi&#39;s second largest slum, to mug people in richer neighbourhoods.
