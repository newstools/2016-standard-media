Kenya has assured the international community that it has prioritised the fight against global warming, with robust legislative plans in place. Environment and Natural Resources Cabinet Secretary Judi Wakhungu said the Government is redirecting resources towards strengthening the country&#39;s domestic climate change agenda. She said President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s administration will continue to work with the various partners in addressing climate vagaries, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, where the Government has included the private sector and the public in conservation programmes. Prof Wakhungu who spoke at the ongoing UN-led climate change talks in Marrakech, Morocco, yesterday said: &quot;Kenya&#39;s vulnerability is evident in the intensity of floods, droughts and reduced crop yields.&quot; President Kenyatta, who is among heads of State attending the conference of parties (COP22), is expected to reaffirm Kenya&#39;s commitment to climate talks as negotiations enter a crucial phase this week. Wakhungu said the Cabinet approval of the Paris agreement, the enactment of the Climate Change Act, &nbsp;and development of an exhaustive national climate change response strategy are milestones in Kenya&#39;s fight against global warming. The historic Paris agreement was signed last year when countries agreed to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels. &nbsp;
