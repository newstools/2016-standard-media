The decision by Pokot elders to install West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo as the community&#39;s spokesman has ignited a supremacy battle among local leaders. Prof Lonyangapuo was last month installed as the community&#39;s spokesman, 16 years after the death of former influential Cabinet Minister Francis Lotodo, who last held the position. And now some Pokot leaders have dismissed the installation process terming it &quot;a mockery to the Pokot community culture&quot;, claiming the exercise was patronised. &quot;At the moment we have our community spokesperson, John Muok, who is also the Pokot Council of Elders&#39; Chairman. Prof Lonyangapuo&#39;s installation is inconsequential because days of kingship are long gone,&quot; said Tiaty MP Asman Kamama. &quot;As one of the Kalenjin sub-tribes, we are represented by our Deputy President William Ruto as our leader and spokesman at the national level who works with the selected council of elders from each sub-tribes and elected leaders.&quot; He questioned why the ceremony was conducted in River Amaya in Tiaty, Baringo County, saying it should have been done in Kapenguria where the community shrine is located.

He lacks the capacity and experience to speak on behalf of the community,&quot; said Kamama. However, former Information Minister Samuel Poghisio lauded the community&#39;s choice of Lonyangapuo as its leader, saying he is best suited to champion the community&#39;s interests. &quot;He has all that is needed to lead and champion the community&#39;s interests and we shall support him,&quot; he said.
