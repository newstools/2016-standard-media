The electoral commission requires an additional Sh19.8 billion to deliver credible 2017 national polls.This brings the total cost of the August 8, 2017 polls to Sh64.8 billion, one of the highest electoral expenditures in the region. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) said the increase in budget from the initial Sh45 billion was due to changes occasioned by the Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016.The law was passed following bi-partisan deliberations between the ruling Jubilee and Opposition CORD coalitions.The new electoral law has capped the number of voters per polling station at 500, increasing the polling stations from 33,000 to 56,000 centres.

And due to the new laws that came to effect on October 4 the commission has pushed forward the Mass Voter Registration (MVR) from February next year to December to allow for the inspection of the register as recommended by the joint select committee.CALENDAR OF EVENTS ALSO READ:Let&rsquo;s all rise and say no to divisive campaigns&quot;Key activities are the timeline for Mass Voter Registration (MVR) and the inspection of the register of voters, which have now been pushed to February next year to allow for the audit of the register,&quot; said IEBC.Currently, the commission is engaging key players in the course of implementing the new law.It has since met the National Assembly&#39;s Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC), which has promised to assist in addressing electoral challenges arising from the law.Strict timelines are some of the challenges the commission raised with JLAC, terming some untenable.According to the law, the commission is required to procure electoral equipment eight months to the poll, putting the deadline on December 8.The law further states that the equipment must be tested, verified and deployed by February 8, next year.&quot;The commission plans to complete key procurement for the General Election by end of February, 2017.
