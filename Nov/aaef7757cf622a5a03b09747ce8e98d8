KARACHI:&nbsp;The Pakistani navy detected an Indian submarine off the Pakistani coast and prevented it from entering its waters, it said in a statement on Friday, as tension between the nuclear-armed rivals simmers. The submarine was detected &quot;south of the Pakistani coast&quot; on Monday, the navy said in a press release. &quot;Thereafter, despite the submarine&#39;s desperate efforts to escape detection, it was continuously tracked by Pakistan Navy Fleet units and pushed well clear of our waters,&quot; the press release said. The navy also released footage and photographs of what it was said was the submarine trying to enter Pakistani waters. The Indian navy was not immediately available for comment.
