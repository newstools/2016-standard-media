At least 50 registered Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) candidates from Likuyani in Kakamega County missed this year&#39;s examinations. County education office became alarmed after the candidates failed to show up to sit for the examinations. And the whereabouts of the affected candidates remain unknown even to their teachers. According to Likuyani education boss David Esemele, investigations have since been launched to establish what could have happened. &quot;For such a big number of candidates to go missing when they should be sitting for the examinations leaves a lot to be desired,&quot; said Mr Esemele. The officer told journalists that most of the candidates were reported to have abandoned school after registering with the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC).

If found to be true, action will be taken accordingly,&quot; he said. The education office is working closely with the Children&#39;s Department in the area and other relevant departments in pursuing the matter. Esemele said each of the candidates will be trailed and those responsible for their disappearance could be arrested and prosecuted for violating the pupils&#39; rights. &quot;Those living with them as wives and those who married them off will be in hot soup,&quot; he said. Elsewhere, the wife of Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Priscilla, has asked parents and churches to inculcate positive values in their children during the December holidays. Speaking during a funds-drive in aid of Buchifi Catholic Church, Ms Oparanya said many children go astray because parents abdicate their responsibilities of guiding and counseling them.
