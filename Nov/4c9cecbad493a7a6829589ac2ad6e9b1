A group of leaders from the Luhya community has vowed to back CORD leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s presidential bid.Speaking during a Busia County leadership retreat in Kisumu, the leaders dismissed what they described as attempts by former ODM Secretary General and Budalangi MP Ababu Namwamba to divide the Luhya vote.Led by Busia County Deputy governor Kizito Wangalwa, the leaders who included more than 30 members of county assembly pledged to seek re-election in the party&rsquo;s ticket and campaign for a Raila presidency. &ldquo;Raila is our flag bearer and no amount of intimidation, ridicule or denigration will change our resolve to back his bid,&rdquo; Wangalwa said.
