After being edged out of elective seats by men in 2013, more women in Taita Taveta County have come out strongly this time around. Scores of women have expressed interest in various county seats as campaigns for 2017 elections gain momentum. Taita has only two women in Parliament - Taveta MP Noami Shaban (Jubilee) and Woman Representative Joyce Lay (ODM). But with nine months to the polls, three women have already declared interest in the senatorial seat. Wundanyi 2013 parliamentary loser Anne Nyambu Kina, former Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) County Assistant Secretary Jones Mwaruma and Cultural Women Action for Peace county coordinator Jenifa Mshai Mwashighadi will seek to succeed Senator Dan Mwazo, who has declared interest in the governor&rsquo;s seat. Ms Kina said she will give men a run for their money. &ldquo;Women shy away from elective positions due to lack of knowledge and funds. They need to be empowered to battle it out with men. We have been competing with men in school and we should also do so in political leadership,&rdquo; said Kina, a medical practitioner. So far, the woman representative seat has attracted eight other candidates, among them a lawyer, a conservationist, businesswomen and sitting members of the county assembly. &nbsp;They include Lydia Haika , Janet Mwawasi, Hope Anisa Mwakio, Rozina Kisochi, former Voi Mayor Pricilla Mwangeka and Anastatia Wakesho. Patience Nyaoga, a director with Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco), has shifted her sights to the Voi parliamentary seat from the crowded woman representative position. She will battle it out with incumbent Jones Mlolwa, Taita Taveta University lecturer Dishon Mngoda and John Maghaga. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
