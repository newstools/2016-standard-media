Over the last one year, indices have shown that prices in the top-end of the market in the country have slowed down. This led to talks of a market slowdown, correction or for doomsday prophets, a property bubble. What nearly everyone agrees on, however, is that this price trend is mostly because developers have for a long time concentrated their efforts on this end of the market, neglecting the lower-middle and lower-income segments.Beyond our borders, the story is the same, but for different reasons. A survey of 37 cities by Knight Frank released this week shows that luxury homes in some of the world&rsquo;s top cities saw a slowdown in price growth in the last quarter as new taxes, elections, referendums and economic jitters took hold.Among them were Vancouver, Toronto, London, Sydney and Melbourne - all cities where new taxes have been imposed in the last 12 months, either in the form of higher stamp duty, additional taxes for foreign buyers or the closing of tax loopholes for non-residents. Many will remember Britain&rsquo;s shock vote to leave the European Union, now better known as Brexit. Even more are aware of the United States acrimonious election campaign that is under way. According to the report, &ldquo;elections and referendums tend to provoke a &lsquo;wait-and-see&rsquo; approach in the minds of buyers evidenced in the run-up to the UK&rsquo;s Brexit vote in June and the forthcoming US presidential election&rdquo;.This year closes with the world market facing similar circumstances, some for very different reasons. The western world is worried more about political decisions. In Kenya, despite a major election campaign period more or less afoot, the biggest challenge has got to do with demand, supply and ability, or lack of it to own homes.
