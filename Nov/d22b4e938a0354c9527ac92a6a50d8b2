Senators&nbsp;have threatened to suspend dealing with Bills forwarded to them by the National Assembly. The&nbsp;senators&nbsp;also vowed to frustrate government business in the House. The threat comes after the National Assembly rejected&nbsp;Senate&#39;s attempt to control a Sh1 billion county oversight fund. The lawmakers yesterday said they will not relent in their quest for the oversight kitty, even as they accused President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s administration of not supporting their push to control the fund. The House vowed to convene a&nbsp;Kamukunji&nbsp;on Tuesday next week to ratify the decision to frustrate further government business and play hard-ball with the National Assembly until the issue is resolved. The decision was communicated by Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki, who said the House was united in the fight for the kitty.

Governor Ruto: We have nothing to show from Jubilee Members of the National Assembly frustrated the last efforts by&nbsp;Senate&nbsp;to access the fund last week after they rejected regulations allowing&nbsp;senators&nbsp;to govern the kitty on grounds that they were against the Public Finance Management Act. But yesterday,&nbsp;senators&nbsp;dismissed the claim that the regulations were illegal, claiming that the rejection was part of a long supremacy battle with the National Assembly. &quot;What the&nbsp;MPs&nbsp;did was a criminal act. It is a subversion of the law and borders on juvenile delinquency,&quot; said Kindiki. &quot;We are not going to entertain any business from the National Assembly or the Executive until this money is released to us. We will suspend all business and on this we will not introduce coalition division and politics,&quot; said the Tharaka Nithi&nbsp;Senator. Minority Leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula accused the Executive of not being keen on the&nbsp;Senate&nbsp;being granted the oversight fund, saying if the President wanted to empower the house to undertake its work, he would rally his&nbsp;MPs&nbsp;to ensure the regulations are passed. &quot;It is apparent that the Executive in this country does not want this House, and we all know that killing&nbsp;senate&nbsp;means killing devolution,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula. The&nbsp;senators&nbsp;said that the pilferage in counties currently being witnessed would be placed under check if the&nbsp;senators&nbsp;were facilitated in their oversight duties. &quot;As long as these governors are not being monitored then this pilferage will continue,&quot; said Mombasa&nbsp;Senator&nbsp;Hassan Omar. Deputy Speaker Kembi Gitura also dismissed claims by the National Assembly that the regulations were legally wanting.
