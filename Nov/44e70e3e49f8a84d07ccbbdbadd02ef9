Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) deputy party leader Hassan Joho yesterday declared that Raila Odinga is the man to beat in next year&#39;s polls. Mr Joho, who is also Mombasa governor, asked CORD co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&#39;ula to stop wasting time and just declare Raila the coalition&#39;s flag bearer. &quot;I want to say without prejudice that it is Raila who has long established political experience and generational wisdom to lead the opposition team against the Jubilee coalition,&quot; said Joho. Although Wiper&#39;s Musyoka and Ford-Kenya&#39;s Wetang&#39;ula have also declared interest for the same seat, Joho asked them to reconsider their stand and if possible step down. &quot;I beseech the leaders in good faith to step down in favour of Raila. He has fought hard, struggled for this country and I am&nbsp; certain he is the one who can face Jubilee head-on,&quot; he added. Joho&#39;s statement is likely to raffle feathers again in the Opposition circles, more so after both Kalonzo and Wetang&#39;ula declared their candidature for the top post.

Joho asked all CORD and ODM stalwarts to launch a door-to-door campaign and mobilise the voters to take ID cards in big numbers. Register to vote &quot;Let us woo young and old eligible voters with ID cards to register to vote. Let us not keep quiet and watch potential voters idle among us in the villages. Let&#39;s urge them to register,&quot; he said Joho pushed up a spirited campaign for Raila during the memorial service for the late former Homa Bay Senator Otieno Kajwang at Waondo village in Mbita Constituency. Joho&#39;s push for a Raila presidency was supported by Senator Boy Juma Boy and Funyula MP Paul Otuoma. However, ODM allies from Nyanza avoided to comment on the issue. &quot;We need warriors now and I am glad Raila is,&quot; Dr Otuoma said and backed proposals by Joho that Raila be declared CORD candidate. Raila who has also in the past stated that the opposition will consult widely and choose its presidential candidate in a free and fair process also steered clear from comment. He said the opposition had been re-energised and would lead a strong &#39;current of votes&#39; that will trounce Jubilee from power. &quot;We are putting Jubilee on notice that come 2017 the will of the masses will prevail against them because they have failed to live up to the people&#39;s expectation,&quot; said Raila. Don&#39;t worry The Opposition leader reminded the voters not to worry about elections and that what they should do is to make sure that they take ID cards and register to vote.
