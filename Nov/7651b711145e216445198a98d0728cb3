Kenya&#39;s &#39;cowboy contractors&#39; got a taste of President John Magufuli&#39;s trademark straight talk yesterday.The tough-talking president known for his zero-tolerance for inefficiency, laziness and corruption threatened to ban road contractors who lack integrity from Tanzania.Speaking at the commissioning of the Nairobi Southern Bypass, Magufuli, who is the current chairman of the East African Community, also gave notice to corrupt road contractors in the region. &quot;When a contractor signs a contract, he must ensure that within two years after completion of the road works, it does not develop potholes,&quot; he said.&quot;Remember, bad and shoddy road works in Kenya will also not be allowed in Tanzania.&quot;Magufuli said he knew how road contractors did business as he has been a minister for roads in the past.&quot;I am speaking as the EAC chairman. This road should be maintained in good shape at all costs. It will be a good idea to have a good road not just in Kenya but in this region,&quot; he said.President Kenyatta said the Southern Bypass had reduced the travel time for trucks driving across Nairobi from three hours to just 30 minutes.The two presidents said the road would ease the flow of goods from the port of Mombasa to land-locked Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.&quot;Trucks using the Northern Corridor from Mombasa crossing through Nairobi City on the way to Kampala used to take more than three hours. But it now takes 30 minutes to cross over,&quot; said Uhuru.Uhuru said the Government would continue to build roads within the city to ease congestion.&quot;It is the local people who benefit from road expansion as the cost of traffic jams is unfortunately passed on to commuters,&quot; he said.Magufuli made light of Nairobi&#39;s traffic congestion, saying it was a source of many social challenges including late dates.&quot;Abiria wanapoteza muda mwingi barabarani hadi mchumba anapata mwenziye keshaondoka (Passengers waste a lot of time on the road; some even find their lovers have left),&quot; he said amid laughter.Magufuli requested the bypass contractors, China Road and Bridge Corporation, who were represented at the event by their Vice President, An Aijun, and Nairobi City County to put up kiosks along the road to enable locals to market their wares.On regional infrastructure development, Magufuli announced that the two countries were committed to eliminating trade barriers that slowed down the movement of goods across the border.&quot;At Namanga, we are putting up a one-stop border post to ensure smooth and free movement of goods and people between our countries,&quot; he said.He announced that plans were underway to build a 178km road linking Malindi to Lunga Lunga and Bagamoyo in Tanzania. A highway linking Isebania in Migori County to northern Tanzania is also expected to open up trade in western Kenya.
