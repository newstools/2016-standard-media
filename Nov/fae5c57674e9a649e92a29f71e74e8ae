British boffins have developed NUCLEAR-powered batteries - but they could take more than 5,000 YEARS to reach just half power.An elite team of physicists and chemists have grown a man-made diamond that, when placed in a radioactive field, is able to generate an electrical current.This will enable it to generate power for many thousands of years - potentially soling the problem of batteries ever running out. The drawback is that the power produced is very low and could take 5,730 years to reach 50 per cent output - about as long as human civilisation has existed.But the team at the University of Bristol reckon the development could solve some of the problems of nuclear waste, clean electricity generation and battery life.Lead researcher Tom Scott, Professor in Materials in the university&rsquo;s Interface Analysis Centre, said: &ldquo;There are no moving parts involved, no emissions generated and no maintenance required, just direct electricity generation.&ldquo;By encapsulating radioactive material inside diamonds, we turn a long-term problem of nuclear waste into a nuclear-powered battery and a long-term supply of clean energy.&rdquo;Most existing electricity-generation technologies use energy to move a magnet through a coil of wire to generate a current.But the man-made diamond is able to produce a charge simply by being placed in close proximity to a radioactive source.The team have demonstrated a prototype &lsquo;diamond battery&rsquo; using Nickel-63 as the radiation source.But they are now working to significantly improve efficiency by utilising carbon-14, a radioactive version of carbon, which is generated in graphite blocks used to moderate the reaction in nuclear power plants.The Bristol team has shown that the radioactive carbon-14 is concentrated at the surface of these blocks, making it possible to process it to remove the majority of the radioactive material.Extracted carbon-14 is then incorporated into a diamond to produce a nuclear-powered battery.The UK currently holds almost 95,000 tonnes of graphite blocks and by extracting carbon-14 from them, their radioactivity decreases, reducing the cost and challenge of safely storing this nuclear waste.Dr Neil Fox from the School of Chemistry explained: &ldquo;Carbon-14 was chosen as a source material because it emits a short-range radiation, which is quickly absorbed by any solid material.&ldquo;This would make it dangerous to ingest or touch with your naked skin, but safely held within diamond, no short-range radiation can escape.&ldquo;In fact, diamond is the hardest substance known to man, there is literally nothing we could use that could offer more protection.&rdquo;Despite their low power relative to current battery technologies, the life-time of these diamond batteries could revolutionise the powering of devices over long timescales.Using carbon-14 the battery would take 5,730 years to reach 50 per cent power. But such a long-term power source would be ideal for electrical devices such as pacemakers, satellites, or even spacecraft.Professor Scott added: &ldquo;We envision these batteries to be used in situations where it is not feasible to charge or replace conventional batteries.&ldquo;Obvious applications would be in low-power electrical devices where long life of the energy source is needed, such as pacemakers, satellites, high-altitude drones or even spacecraft.&ldquo;There are so many possible uses that we&rsquo;re asking the public to come up with suggestions of how they would utilise this technology by using diamondbattery.&rdquo;
