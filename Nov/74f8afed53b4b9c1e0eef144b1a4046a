Residents of Kirinyaga County yesterday held a demonstration to defend former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru against attacks over the National Youth Service (NYS) scandal.Women and youths hit out at Deputy President William Ruto for linking Waiguru to the scandal in his public rallies.&quot;Waiguru is not Ruto&#39;s equal and when the DP goes public in rallies where the former CS cannot defend herself, it is unfair,&quot; said Rose Njeru. The protesters, who demonstrated in Kutus town yesterday, wondered why Ruto had forgotten it was women who kept on praying over his ICC case.Waving placards, the protesters said Ruto should have reported the matter to institutions investigating the NYS scam instead of speaking in political rallies. Aisha Muriithi said the ongoing exchange of words between Ruto and the DP was unhealthy for Kenyans.She defended Waiguru from any wrongdoing, saying she had appeared before the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) over the matter and the outcome will be made public.Some of the placards read: Leave Waiguru alone; Youth na Waiguru; Waiguru is innocent; Let Ruto testify at the PAC and not in public rallies.
