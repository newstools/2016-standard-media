The battle for Mbiyu Koinange&#39;s multi-billion-shilling estate is&nbsp;yet to be settled 36 years on. The epic war pitting the late minister&#39;s children and two women claiming to be his widows is being fought in the second highest court in the land, making it the longest succession battle ever in Kenya. Ms Margaret Njeri, one of the women who was stripped of the right to inherit part of the politician&#39;s Sh17 billion estate, went to the High Court to stop distribution of the wealth. In her application submitted in court in November 2015 barely a month after a ruling that stripped her of the &#39;widow&#39; status, Njeri wants the court to put on hold the distribution exercise until her appeal against the High Court judgment is heard and determined. In the September ruling, High Court judge William Musyoka had not only stripped Njeri and her &#39;co-wife&#39; Eddah Wanjiru of the widow status, but also ordered the two to give back what they had acquired from the former powerful minister who served in Jomo Kenyatta&#39;s government. Wanjiru had been one of the managers of the late Koinange&#39;s estate for 33 years.

Consequently, Wanjiru lost 11,000 shares at a famous resort at Ocean View hotel in Mombasa County At the time of the ruling, the only assets available (as others were claimed to have been sold by the two women illegally) were Muthera Farm in Mau Narok (4,292 acres), Koira Ltd, Waihuthia Farm in Limuru (198 acres), Thindigua Farm (98 acres), a farmland at Closeburn Estate (176 acres) and Ikinu farm, among others. But in her application, Njeri had argued that the circumstances surrounding the inheritance battle was being driven more by emotions and it would be devastating for the court to later find that she together with her disputed co-wife (Wanjiru) were actually legally married to the deceased.
