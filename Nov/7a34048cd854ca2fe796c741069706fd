ODM on high alert as Jubilee ignites raid on key stronghold Corruption will plunge Kenya into economic crisis, Raila warns Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali said the Head of State would tour Webuye Pan Paper mill to &#39;switch on&#39; the factory after presiding over the graduation ceremony. The factory closed its doors in 2009 and rendered hundreds of locals jobless. The factory, which the Government sold to Rai Group of investors at a cost of Sh900 million, is key in Jubilee Party&#39;s bid to woo the region ahead of the 2017 elections. Washiali said Jubilee leaders in the region would request Uhuru to stay longer to popularise himself and the party. On Raila&#39;s visit, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who is also ODM deputy party leader, said the planned meeting would bring together party delegates and supporters from Kakamega, Bungoma, Vihiga, Busia and Trans Nzoia counties. Oparanya said the meeting has been arranged by regional ODM leaders. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
