A 17-year-old girl was gang-raped yesterday at Tayari village of Molo sub-county, Nakuru County while heading to school. The Form Four candidate was waylaid as she headed to school to sit for the ongoing Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations. Molo OCPD Daniel Kamanza said the student was attacked by a gang of four men armed with machetes. The officer said the girl was in a group of two of her classmates; a boy and a girl, when they met the men. He said the other two students escaped unhurt and the victim, while on her heels, fell, then the thugs caught up with her and committed the beastly act. &quot;The girl was in the company of two classmates but along the road, they bumped into a group of men armed with pangas who threatened them and in the process defiled the girl,&quot; said Mr Kamanza. The officer said the classmates sought the help of the villagers who responded by rushing to the area to find one of the men in the act.&nbsp; He was arrested.
