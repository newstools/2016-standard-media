A team of senior officers met and reviewed the command and structure of the police units before announcing the changes. The changes will see traffic operations moved from its headquarters along Thika Road, Nairobi. &ldquo;The review committee has decided to put the command and operations of traffic under the county commanders,&rdquo; said a senior officer aware of the developments. Deputy Inspector General of police Joel Kitili said the decentralization is aimed at ensuring better management of affairs. &ldquo;County commanders will be responsible for the day to day traffic operations and the personnel, arms, vehicles&nbsp;and other equipment will be directly under their charge,&rdquo; he said. County and divisional traffic officers have been reporting to the traffic commandant in terms of operations. The current traffic commandant is Jecinta Kinyua. In the new arrangements, traffic headquarters will manage research, government vehicle unit, and check unit, highway patrol, driving schools, and National Transport and Safety Authority officers, formulation of policies and organization of courses for officers at various levels. The move was praised by many police commanders who said it will make management and operations easy. This will mean if there are claims of corruption at a certain area, the county commander will be asked to explain and take action. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
