A group of ODM supporters yesterday staged a demonstration in defence of Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi over the loss of the Sh51 million in the county.&nbsp; The demonstrators said it was unfair for Deputy President William Ruto to castigate Kingi over the loss at the county, yet Jubilee had failed to address mega corruption in Government. The demo in Malindi town followed one in Mtwapa town that was staged against Kingi on Thursday by Jubilee supporters. Kingi suspended ten officers who have been linked closely with the disappearance of the Sh51 million meant for development. While on a tour of Kilifi on Thursday, Ruto said the action taken by the Governor was not enough and asked Kingi to take political responsibility. But yesterday the protestors stood by their Governor and told off the DP. Carrying placards and chanting anti Ruto messages, they claimed that the DP was intimidating governor Kingi in a bid to bully him into ditching ODM and join the Jubilee Party. Kilifi County MP Aisha Jumwa told off the DP saying Ruto should first deal with the officials close to him and in his office mentioned in graft in his office before commenting on Kilifi matters. Former Councillor Timothy Mwambogo who was also part of the demonstrators said it would not be business as usual for the Jubilee administration in 2017. &quot;Jubilee has to give an account of all funds stolen by its officers under its watch,&quot; he said.
