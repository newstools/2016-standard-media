Gichugu Member of Parliament Njogu Barua has told aspirants to brace for joint campaign rallies. Barua, who is also the Kirinyaga County Coordinator for President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election campaign team, said gubernatorial, senatorial, MP, women rep and senatorial aspirants will be required to campaign for the President&#39;s re-election and campaign for themselves on completely separate forums. &#39;&#39;Aspirants will have to hold their separate campaign rallies and popularise themselves individually and not during the presidential ones where maximum outreach will be expected,&#39;&#39; Barua said. Speaking at Guama Primary School grounds where he presented 305 water pipes to the Ngumara water project in the area, he observed that such joint campaign rallies will be expected to attract mammoth crowds where Uhuru&#39;s re-election agenda will be the dominant feature. &quot;I am planning for preparatory meetings with all the aspirants of various elective positions and incumbents where electioneering campaign rallies for President Uhuru&#39;s re-election will be planned and executed at the earliest,&quot; he said. The legislator said the county should count itself lucky to have been given a slot in the presidential campaign team saying: &#39;&#39;I assure residents that I will use this position to ensure we conduct vigorous campaigns for the President with a projected 100 per cent voter turnout,&#39;&#39; he said.
