South Sudan said it recognises the role that Kenya plays in its peace process and urged United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to consult appropriately with Kenya in order solve the matter and create mutual understanding between the intergovernmental organisation, Kenya and&nbsp;South Sudan. &ldquo;The TGoNU also pleads with the Government of the Republic of Kenya to give itself time as we hope the United Nations reviews and reconsiders its decision on the dismissal of Lt Genearl Johnson Ondieki and amicably resolve the matter in conformity with standard operating procedures,&rdquo; said South Sudan spokesperson Michael Makuei Lueth. Ondieki, who took office in June 2016, was dismissed from the position of United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) field commander and Kenya advised to nominate a replacement. Ki-Moon dismissed Ondieki on grounds that he had failed to protect protect the citizens of South Sudan.
