The King of Bamasaba in Uganda, Bob Mushikori, has challenged Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula to unite communities in his county before setting his sights on the presidency. Speaking yesterday at Mabanga Farmers Training Centre in Bungoma during &lsquo;The First Bukusu Conference&rsquo;, Mushikori asked Wetang&rsquo;ula to ensure locals speak with one voice.He said once the Bukusu and the Bamasaba communities are united, it will be easier for the Bukusu leader to seek higher office.&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t met or heard from Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, where is he? I only hear that he wants to be president. My son, don&rsquo;t rush to power, unite our community first then let&rsquo;s move together. United we prosper, divided we fall,&rdquo; said King Mushikori. Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba accused the Bukusu community leaders of fighting each other.&ldquo;The Bukusu community is the majority in Western and North Rift region but infighting and backstabbing amongst its leaders is the greatest undoing. I hope this conference will make a difference,&rdquo; said Khaemba. Bukusu Council of Elders official Richard Walukano said the conference was meant to unite local leaders. &ldquo;Despite our various political inclinations, we should remember that we are a people from the same mother. Let&rsquo;s unite in developing this county so that we can defeat our enemies,&rdquo; he said.Retired ACK Arch Bishop Eliud Wabukala asked religious leaders to lead peace efforts in Bungoma.&ldquo;Peace is paramount and it should be preached by all religious leaders if we need to realise development in this region,&rdquo; said Wabukala.
