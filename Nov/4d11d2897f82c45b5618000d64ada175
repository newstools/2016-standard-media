Kenya and other African countries are set to benefit from a $12 billion (Sh1.2 trillion) facility announced by the African Development Bank (AfDB) to fund renewable energy projects.The funds will be spent over the next five years under the African Renewable Energy Initiative of the Africa Union (AU). Speaking at the ongoing UN-led climate change talks in Marrakech, Morocco, AfDB officials said the financing will empower countries to scale up harnessing of their renewable energy potential.The bank&rsquo;s president Akiwumi Adesina said the fund will help African countries add value to what they produce, speed up industrialisation and move to the top of the global value chain.The initiative targets to deliver 10 Gigawatts of electricity by 2020 and 300 Gigawatts by 2030.Other initiatives African countries are betting on to address power shortfalls include US President Barack Obama&rsquo;s $7 billion (Sh701 billion) Power Africa Project and the Akon lighting Africa initiative.Kenya&rsquo;s Turkana wind power project got a special mention at the conference, with the European Union pledging support to the project billed to be Africa&rsquo;s largest wind energy initiative. Kenya has also substantially increased geothermal and solar exploitation besides considering going into nuclear power by 2025.According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, the country consumes up to 6.6 billion kilowatt hour (KWh) of electricity annually, against production of 8.4 billion KWh.Yesterday, Mr Adesina said through the new facility, AU countries will be expected to re-position themselves to implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement.Under the historic agreement, which came into force early this month, a record 200 countries agreed to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.It came into force this month and its implementation will require cuts in use of fossil fuels. The deal has already been ratified by 109 countries. Mr Adesina said on top of the $ 12 billion (Sh1.2 trillion) the bank had set aside for the initiative, Germany had committed two million Euros to the project besides six million Euros given by France to support the AfDB Independent Delivery Unit.The bank official spoke at an event christened &ldquo;The Africa Day&rdquo; chaired by Guinea President Alpha Cond&eacute;.
