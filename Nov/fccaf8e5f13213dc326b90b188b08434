Wiper Party leader&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;Musyoka has taken cue from ODM and began a process to throw out seven rebel members.Although the party had initially indicated it would not&nbsp;expel&nbsp;its elected leaders who have joined Jubilee, Mr&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;yesterday said Wiper had been forced to take the action over what he termed as a scheme by the ruling coalition to weaken the Opposition.In its special National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Nairobi, the party resolved to summon Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, and MPs John Munuve (Mwingi North), Joe Mutambo (Mwingi Central), Katemi Makenga (Kaiti), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni) and Robert Mutemi (nominated) to explain why they should not be removed from the party&#39;s membership list. Wiper Secretary General Senator Hassan Omar said the party will conclude the whole process within two weeks.&quot;The party has resolved the affected members be summoned to appear before the disciplinary committee. Members of the county assemblies whose loyalty to the party has been put in question will also be summoned to appear before the disciplinary committee,&quot; said the Mombasa senator.He said the members have been served with show cause letters and are expected to be grilled on November 11 and 12.
