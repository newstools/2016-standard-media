President Yoweri Museveni&rsquo;s government is not renowned for its fidelity to democratic principles. It is a government more famous for its crackdown on the freedoms of expression, association and the Press. The enthusiasm with which the police have gone out of its way to crush Opposition leader Kizzya Besigye and his supporters depict a regime under siege. In fact, others treated as adversaries like the media have had to tread carefully around Mr Museveni&rsquo;s government. A year ago, soldiers opened fire on journalists, killing one in Kampala. So the arrest of KTN News anchor Joy-Doreen Biira on trumped-up charges of assisting Ugandan rebels allied to King Charles Mumbere of Rwenzururu kingdom did not come as a surprise. When government soldiers engaged Mumbere&rsquo;s loyalists, Ms Biira&rsquo;s journalistic instinct kicked in. She posted pictures of what is turning out to be a macbre massacre with 62 reported deaths. That was not enough reason to arrest the journalist. Even as he fights growing internal rebellion, Mr Museveni, 72, should not use media as a scapegoat. He could yet realise that media is the only true friend of his government and most importantly, to Uganda&rsquo;s benighted masses, who he openly confesses great love for.
