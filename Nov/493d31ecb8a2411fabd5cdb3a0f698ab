The government is proposing to add Sh32.7 billion to the counties&rsquo; coffers in the next financial year, pushing the total allocation to Sh334.9 billion. In proposals contained in a draft Budget Policy Statement for the 2017-18 financial year, Meru County will be the biggest winner if the plans are approved. According to the draft now open to public for comments, Meru County will get Sh12.2 billion in the next financial year. This is 29 per cent higher than the Sh9.42 billion it has been allocated in the current financial year. The county will get Sh3.95 billion in form of loans and grants, being the highest among the 47 counties. Only Nairobi comes closer with Sh2.15 billion. Governor Peter Munya&rsquo;s (pictured) county will also receive Sh123.8 million for free maternity and Sh196.8 million as road maintenance levy fund. Nairobi County, which still tops in terms of total allocation and the only other county that will see double digit per cent increase in allocation, stands to get Sh17.98 billion. This will be 19.9 per cent hike from the Sh14.99 it expects to get by the lapse of the current financial year.
