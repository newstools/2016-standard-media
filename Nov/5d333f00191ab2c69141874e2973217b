The Opposition will not accept &quot;another rigged&quot; election in 2017, ODM party leader Raila Odinga has warned.Raila claimed the ruling Jubilee coalition was working with the outgoing nine electoral commissioners to manipulate the electoral process in their favour. He said Issack Hassan&#39;s team was deliberately still in office to commit illegalities on behalf of Jubilee.The former premier said they would resist any attempt to water down the electoral reforms, claiming Jubilee was planning to bring a proposal in the National Assembly to amend the Electoral Amendment Act passed following weekly protests to eject IEBC commissioners by the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) luminaries.&quot;We must take a firm stand on the illegalities going on at the IEBC where commissioners who are legally and officially out of office are still transacting business, setting the rules of the game and seeking to reverse the law,&quot; said Raila.&quot;They are part of the bandit regime that thrives on impunity, confusion and law of the jungle. ODM will not endorse the impunity and the illegality being committed at the IEBC,&quot; he added.select committeeIEBC has raised issues over strict timelines set by the joint select committee and is seeking they be reviewed ahead of the August 8 polls.The commission has complained about the deadline set for the procurement of electoral equipment.According to the electoral laws, the commission is required to acquire electoral equipment eight months to the polls, putting the deadline on December 8, which is just a month away.There are already talks that the commission may be allowed to engage in direct procurement of the kits. In the 2013 polls, there was a government-to-government procurement arrangement that was partly blamed for the bungling of the polls.Raila also talked about the formation of a national super alliance, saying the next polls will not be about ODM or CORD but about defeating Jubilee&#39;s runaway corruption.&quot;Being election-ready means ODM must strengthen, not weaken its ties with our coalition partners Wiper and Ford Kenya to form a much stronger union founded on the values of trust and mutual respect. We must also lead in opening our doors for other like-minded parties, individuals and organisations to join us,&quot; he said.Raila said the party must reach out to all the parties that &quot;hate the rape of our country by Jubilee; those who hate the tribalism, nepotism, impunity and the forces of revision who believe our best days were in the past&quot;.
