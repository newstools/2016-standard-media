The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Morocco&nbsp;and other partners have launched three new initiatives to step up climate change action in agriculture.The initiatives &mdash; Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA), Global Framework on Water Scarcity and the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Morocco are designed to assist small-scale farmers cope in the wake of climate change.They were launched at Action Event, which aims to boost concerted efforts by the public and private sectors to cut emissions rapidly, help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build a sustainable future. Most countries consider agriculture among their adaptation or mitigation priorities to help limit global temperature rise, in line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement.Practices such as use of nitrogen-efficient and heat-tolerant crop varieties, improved water harvesting, zero-tillage and sustainable soil management lead to improvements in food security as well as resilience to climate change.Climate funds and agricultural projects are expected to have positive global implications on farming.&ldquo;This is an initiative which seeks to act as a voice for African agriculture in the climate arena,&rdquo; said Aziz Akhannouch Moroccan Minister for Agriculture.Mohamed Badraoui, Chair of the Scientific Committee of the AAA Initiative said the AAA initiative aims to build the resilience of farmers in Africa by promoting sustainable soil management, better water management and risk management.Jos&eacute; Graziano da Silva, FAO Director-General said in many countries, adapting to climate change and finding ways to ensure food security and nutrition are part of the same challenge.The FAO initiative aims to identify priority actions and drive innovation for agriculture adaptation to water-scarce conditions, which are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change.Maria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General said higher temperatures, increasing variability of rainfall, more frequent droughts and floods, and sea level rise are all disrupting the amount of water available for crops, livestock, forests and fisheries.&ldquo;Agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of global water withdrawals, and more water will be needed to produce nutritious and sufficient food for a growing population,&rdquo; she said.To speed up and scale up climate action, the third new initiative discussed at the Agriculture and Food Security Action Event involves public participation in urban and peri-urban areas.Introduced last year, the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact calls for sustainable food systems that foster the accessibility of healthy food to urban citizens, biodiversity protection and food waste reduction.The pact was signed by the mayors of 130 cities around the world.Mithika Mwenda, secretary general of Pan African Climate Justice Alliance said the programme is good for Kenya because the country is facing drought and hunger.&ldquo;We need to grow climate resilient crops to address food security in Kenya. Our people shouldn&rsquo;t be dying when we have rain. Let Government take this initiatives seriously and help alleviate human suffering,&rdquo; Mithika said.The high-level climate talks come to an end this week.&nbsp;
