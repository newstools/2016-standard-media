A case against an Egerton University lecturer charged with raping his 21-year-old student has been pushed to December 8. Evans Ngeno is said to have raped the Njoro campus student on September 2 after giving her a lift in his car. The applicant said Ngeno diverted the car to a murram road and when they reached Soilo, he forced himself on her. The woman said the lecturer even inquired about her HIV status before forcing her to have sex with him. The case came up for hearing Thursday but it was postponed. Ngeno, who has denied the charges, is out on a Sh200,000 bond.
