Mark said: &quot;It&#39;s not quite what you expect to find when you got to the toilet.&quot;The next problem we&#39;ve got is how you get a dragon out of the toilet.&quot;He looks quite comfortable.&quot;Along with some of the locals he and the film crew dragged a piece of rotting flesh and tempted the dragon back out.But his visit wouldn&#39;t have been complete without him leaving a little &#39;present&#39; for his host.Komodo is one of the 17,508 islands in Indonesia and is the only habitat of the Komodo dragons - the largest lizard on Earth, which is named after the island.
