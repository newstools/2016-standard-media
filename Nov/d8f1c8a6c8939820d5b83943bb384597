&nbsp; Abuja:ABUJA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The 21 Chibok schoolgirls freed by Boko Haram militants last month say they were not abused or raped during two-and-a-half years&#39; captivity in northeast Nigeria, a source close to the presidency said on Wednesday. Many girls kidnapped by the Islamist militant group have been used as sex slaves, fighters and even suicide bombers, according to rights groups including Amnesty International. But the 21 freed girls said the militants treated them well while they were held captive, according to a confidential report based on their two-week debriefing prepared for President Muhammadu Buhari and seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The girls, released last month after Switzerland and the Red Cross brokered a deal, are now being held in a secret location in the capital Abuja for assessment by the Nigerian government.

More than 200 girls were seized from their school in April 2014 in Chibok in Borno state, where Boko Haram has waged a seven-year insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic state, killing thousands and displacing more than 2 million people. Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds of men, women and children but the abduction of the Chibok girls - some 200 of whom are still missing - prompted outrage worldwide and their plight was publicized using a Twitter hashtag, #bringbackourgirls. &nbsp; GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
