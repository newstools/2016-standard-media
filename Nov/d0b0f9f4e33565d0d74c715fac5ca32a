A girl who almost lost her eyesight a few months ago will sit the national exams after a successful surgery.Valerie Kerubo, a student at St Charles Lwanga Girls High School in Kisii County, started developing eye problems this year. By April, the matter had taken such a toll on Kerubo that she was considering dropping out of school as she could no longer read.But she will now be among the 135 Form Four classmates who will sit the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams at the school today.According to doctors at the PCEA Kikuyu Eye Hospital who diagnosed her condition, Kerubo had lost nearly 80 per cent of her sight.She required an urgent corneal surgery but her peasant parents could not afford to fund the operation.After her sad story was highlighted by&nbsp;The Standard, well wishers, led by the County Government of Nyamira, came to her rescue as more than Sh500,000 was raised to help her undergo the cornea transplant.It was a delicate operation that required the first eye, which had been affected to a large degree, be operated on first before the second one, which was not too bad.&quot;She was supposed to be treated in two phases but the first one was the most critical since it was to be done on the most affected right eye. Fortunately, it was very successful and now she will sit her exams as she awaits the second one,&quot; said the family&#39;s spokesman, Dr Polycarp Maranga.When we visited her at the school, she was prepared to tackle the exams, which kick off today.&quot;I have the confidence to sit the papers and I have no shadow of doubt that I will be able to get the best grades despite the fact that the illness took much of my prep time,&quot; said Kerubo.The school head Joyce Orioki said teachers and other staff had played a role in guiding her through her preparations for the exams and they were confident she will perform well.&quot;Since she came back to school, all our teachers have been giving her special attention, which we are sure will help her pass with the best grades,&quot; said Ms Orioki.
