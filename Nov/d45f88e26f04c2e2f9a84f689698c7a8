Migori Governor Okoth Obado could face prosecution after the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko forwarded his file to the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission, recommending that he be investigated over graft allegations.Obado&rsquo;s woes started in 2004 when anti-graft officers opened investigations over corruption allegations. These were triggered by queries raised by the Controller of Budget and Auditor-General over various procurement procedures, unsupported claims worth over Sh400 million and unclear payments to Gor Mahia football club.Among the audit queries were how a clerical officer claimed Sh16 million for traveling, accommodation and subsistence. The officer drew huge claims which included an unsupported imprest of Sh32 million, in a day. Queries have also been made about air tickets worth Sh 616,200 bought for the Governor and a delegation of 13 to travel to Mombasa in December 2013. The county paid a bill of Sh 1.7 million for the delegation&rsquo;s accommodation.
