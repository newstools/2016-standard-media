He then visited Nairobi Women&rsquo;s Hospital and after several tests, he was diagnosed with kidney failure. &ldquo;I was fixed with a cannula in the right hand to help me drain urine and clean my blood.

I am young and productive with a young family that I need to take care of.&rdquo; Muema&rsquo;s M-Pesa pay bill number is 835853; the account name is Donald Muema Medical Appeal.
