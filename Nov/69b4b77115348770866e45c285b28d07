GENEVA:&nbsp;The United Nations said on Friday it was working with Saudi Arabia to try to bring Yemen&#39;s government to peace talks after it rejected a plan brokered by the United States. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday that the Saudi-led coalition, that backs the government in its fight against the Houthi group, supported a ceasefire plan that the Houthis have agreed to. But President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi&#39;s administration rejected Kerry&#39;s move, complaining that it played into the hands of the Houthis and sidelined the government. &quot;We are working very closely with Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region that can influence (the parties to the conflict),&quot; U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson told a news conference in Geneva. &quot;We have discovered a stronger and stronger view that this war must come to an end but we have to bring them back to negotiating table,&quot; he said, giving no timeline. The Houthis said on Wednesday they were ready to stop fighting and join a national unity government, raising hopes of a resolution to a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people.&nbsp; READ MORE Trump may discuss U.S. secretary of state job with critic Romney: source AMISOM requests for 9,000 more soldiers ahead of 2018 exit plans US will honour its pledges, Kerry tells climate summit
