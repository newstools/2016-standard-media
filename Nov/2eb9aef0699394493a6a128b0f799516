ASIA: China and the United States must avoid being overly suspicious of each other&#39;s strategic intentions, China&#39;s ambassador to the United States said on Wednesday while looking ahead to the Presidency of Donald Trump. Trump lambasted China throughout the U.S. election campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office. He has also vowed to build up the U.S. Navy in what advisers say will be a strategy to reassure countries in the Asia-Pacific worried about China&#39;s assertive pursuit of territorial claims. China&#39;s Washington envoy, Cui Tiankai, told a film screening to commemorate the 1979 normalization of U.S.-China ties that after &ldquo;a most unusual political season,&rdquo; it was important to build consensus and identify common ground. He said both countries were already cooperating on many issues, but added: &quot;We have to make greater efforts to promote better mutual understanding and we should be careful not to be overly suspicious about each other&rsquo;s strategic intentions.

I am quite confident that, on the whole, the relationship will move forward on a stable and right track.&quot; Cui said the countries had a shared responsibility to cooperate on issues such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. &quot;We both want stability in the world. We both strive for a stronger global economy, and we both need a better natural environment. Common goals call for a close partnership.&quot; Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Monday and Xi told the U.S. President-elect cooperation was the only choice for the world&#39;s two largest economies, while Trump said they had established a &quot;clear sense of mutual respect.&quot; GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
