The Court has rejected efforts by an environment NGO to have construction of a multi-billion shilling dam in Kuresoi North Nakuru County stopped. Kipsigis Council of Elders and Ecosystem Social Economic Development Organisation (ESEDO), had moved to court to have the multi-billion shilling dam stopped. But Justice Sila Munyao in Nakuru declined to issue conservatory orders preventing the construction of&nbsp;Itare dam&nbsp; until the hearing and determination of an application filed on September 15. Kipsigis Council of Elders from Kericho and Bomet together with ESEDO had moved to court through their lawyers Gordon Ogolla and Kipkoech Ng&rsquo;etich to seek orders to have the project stalled. They claim that the government had failed to provide an environmental impact assessment project and that public participation was not conducted. Consequently, they had sued Rift Valley Water Service Board, Cabinet Secretary Water and Irrigation Eugene Wamalwa and the Attorney General Githu Muigai.
