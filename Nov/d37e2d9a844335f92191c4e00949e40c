Deputy President William Ruto wants only Jubilee Party candidates to be elected in next year&#39;s General Election. He said the party, under President Uhuru Kenyatta, had a structured development agenda to transform the country and unite all the communities.Speaking in Maragua town during an inspection tour of projects, Mr Ruto accused the Opposition of lacking leadership and said their plan was to divide Kenyans through malicious propaganda. &quot;Hatutaki madodoa wakati wa uchaguzi. Viongozi wote wawe wa Jubilee ile mimi na mheshiwa Rais Uhuru Kenyatta tunaongoza,&quot; (We should vote in only candidates from Jubilee Party, which the President and I are leading)&quot; said Ruto. He was accompanied by Governor Mwangi wa Iria, Senator Kembi Gitura, MPs Peter Kamande (Maragua), Sabina Chege (Murang&#39;a) and Moses Kuria (Gatundu South) and Majority Leader Aden Duale. &quot;There is need to go to the election in uniform. Our competitors, the CORD family, remain a gang that has lost focus. They have not decided who their presidential candidate will be,&quot; said Ruto.
