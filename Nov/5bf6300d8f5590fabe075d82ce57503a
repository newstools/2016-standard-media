Norwegian Jonny Andersen has taken up his new job as the managing director of the Kenya Airport Authority (KAA).He was appointed in July to fill the vacancy left after the sacking of former boss Lucy Mbugua last year. It has been a highly-charged recruitment characterised by major infighting among the board of directors which saw former chairman David Kimaiyo sent packing in June.Mr Andersen (pictured) takes over from Nicholas Bodo who succeeded Yatich Kangogo who was fired in September. Until his arrival at KAA, Andersen was the managing director of an airport back home in Norway. &nbsp;&ldquo;With its strategic geographical location, Kenya is an ideal gateway into the continent and a regional aviation hub. I look forward to harnessing this potential to build prosperity for the authority and the country as a whole,&rdquo; he said yesterday.Julius Karangi, the Chairman of the KAA Board of Directors said he expects the new chief executive to help end graft.-Moses Michira&nbsp;
