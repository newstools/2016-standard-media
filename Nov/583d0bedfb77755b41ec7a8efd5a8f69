Two students are sitting for their Kenya Certificate&nbsp;of Secondary Education (KCSE) in a police cell after they were arrested over a robbery with violence incident in Nairobi. The two, who were arrested on Tuesday, sat for their paper in the Kilimani police cells after a court allowed police to detain them there while conducting further investigations into the attack. A third student is at large and efforts to trace him are ongoing. Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said the three had attacked a pedestrian on November 4 in Jamhuri area and robbed him of his shoes, laptop, mobile phone, assorted clothes and a bottle of perfume. &ldquo;In the process, the victim managed to identify one of the attackers and reported the matter to police,&rdquo; said Koome.
