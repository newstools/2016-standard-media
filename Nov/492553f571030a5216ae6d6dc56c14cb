Turkana Central legislator John Lodepe has faulted his fellow MPs in Jubilee in the county for sabotaging his relationship with Deputy President (DP) William Ruto. Lodepe said his relationship with the DP remains intact and that he had no intention to ditch Jubilee for another political outfit. The legislator claimed that some of his colleagues who decamped to the Jubilee Party recently in Turkana have been spreading rumours that he is planning to ditch Jubilee party for the CORD. &quot;I have no intention to decamp to CORD since I still serve the interest of my party which took me to parliament. Those who spread lies about me are party sycophants within Jubilee,&quot; Lodepe said. The legislator accused the area Jubilee leaders of feeding the DP with lies that he had developed an affiliation with Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party following his closeness to the Turkana governor Josphat Nanok. The MP claimed that his colleagues sneaked to the DP&#39;s office and his Karen home without him but they got shocked when they saw him joining them in the discussion after&nbsp;the DP himself alerted him of their presence through a text message.
