Nine governors from Western region have left for the US in search of development partners.Led by Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, who chairs the Lake Region Economic Bloc, the team is seeking major partnership deals. The bloc is made up of 13 counties from Nyanza, Western and parts of Rift Valley. They include Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Bomet, Kericho, Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Kakamega, Vihiga and Busia.The governors who left yesterday are Cornel Rasanga (Siaya), Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Isaac Ruto (Bomet), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Kenneth Lusaka (Busia) and Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia). The rest are expected to travel in the course of the week. The visit will last one week.Speaking before they left the country, Mr Ranguma said the purpose of the visit was to sell the bloc&#39;s economic blueprint and negotiate for financing of the counties&#39; joint projects that include a proposed regional bank, factories for local produce and road networks.&quot;We are going to the US for a series of engagements including a round table with major development donors,&quot; he said.SHARED RESOURCES&quot;As a bloc, our intention is to leverage on the shared resources so we can build a socio-economic system that gives best opportunities and reaps dividends for our people.&quot;So far, the bloc has successfully set up a secretariat in Kisumu and negotiated the setting up of a world-class regional referral hospital in Kisii and Kisumu, with diagnostic centres in all the 13 counties.&quot;Ranguma said the delegation would visit Washington DC and meet with congressmen today before meeting with investors at the US Chamber of Commerce offices.The team will also have a consultative meeting with the Virginia Economic Development Agency on Tuesday, before meeting experts in tilapia and sorghum farming at Virginia State University.On Wednesday, the governors are expected to have a round table meeting with USAid; on Thursday they will meet US Department of Commerce and Deloitte trade and investment practitioners before concluding with a meeting with the World Bank on Friday.&quot;We have begun the process of acquiring a banking institution to be wholly owned by the residents of the lake region,&quot; added Ranguma.In order to make the bloc&#39;s objectives operational, the governors commissioned Deloitte East Africa to develop the Lake Region Economic Blueprint, which was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in April 2015.The blueprint focuses on seven critical areas for development: the productive pillars of agriculture and tourism; the social pillars of health and education, and the enablers of ICT, infrastructure and financial services.
