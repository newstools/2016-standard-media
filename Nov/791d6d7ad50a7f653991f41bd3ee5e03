Managing childhood diabetes is much more complicated than managing it in an adult. This is mostly because it becomes difficult to keep track of all foods a child eats during the day, and also the activities the child takes part in, especially if they go to school.It is, therefore, important to start by understanding the condition. Read about diabetes, how it comes about and how food affects blood sugar levels. Share this knowledge with your child as soon as they are able to understand. Keeping your child informed about his or her diabetes is important because it will help when it comes to adhering to meals and medication timing.Secondly, get a great meal plan for your child to follow. There is no such thing as a diabetic diet since whatever a diabetic needs to eat is also what non-diabetics need to eat for general health. This should therefore not make it too difficult to follow. The meal plan, however, will help ensure regular meals which are rich in essential nutrients like fibre, vitamins, minerals and energy. This will help to avoid sugar highs (hyperglycemia) and lows (hypoglycemia). In addition to the meal plan, sit together with your child and draw a food diary for him or her to keep track of what they eat. This way, they can also be in a position to notice and understand the effect of different foods on their blood sugar levels.Check your child&rsquo;s blood sugar regularly, including before and after meals. This will enlighten you in case of any dangers of high or low blood sugar levels.Diabetic children who are also involved in sports need to adjust their meals, snacks and their medication. This is because sports and exercise use up the body&rsquo;s energy, leading to hypoglycemia. It is important to keep track of this, too.
