Politicians whose supporters caused violence in Awendo on Sunday will be held responsible, police have said. Five people were injured when supporters of Governor Okoth Obado and those of his challenger Ochilo Ayacko clashed during a fundraiser at Manyatta Secondary School. Awendo Officer Commanding Police Division David Kinyua said: &quot;We will not condone any form of hooliganism in Awendo. Politicians must obey the law and restrain their supporters during public functions.&quot; County criminal investigations boss Benedict Kigen said they were alarmed by growing political violence and they would convene a security meeting with all aspirants. Area MP Jared Kopiyo and Lands Executive Elizabeth Ochae, who had represented the governor at the Sunday function, had to be whisked away to safety by their security agents as chaos reigned for close to half an hour. Trouble began when a man allied to Mr Ayacko made statements that did not go down well with Mr Obado&#39;s supporters.

Obado&#39;s supporters confronted the man and a fight between them and Ayacko&#39;s supporters ensued. Mr Kopiyo condemned the incident, saying organisers ought to have made proper security arrangements for a gathering of such magnitude. He claimed the organisers had planned the chaos and demanded an apology. &quot;As the senior-most political leader in the constituency, I will not tolerate leaders out to tarnish the image of this constituency by shedding blood of innocent people, &quot;Kopiyo warned.
