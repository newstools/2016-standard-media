A swarm of bees attacked and killed the former chairman of the defunct Mumias Outgrowers Company.Basil Misango, 74, who was also a Kanu leader in Lurambi constituency, was attacked after a hawk disturbed a beehive at his home in Eshisiru, Kakamega.The bees also attacked his wife and two children who have been hospitalised. The hive was located in the ceiling board of Mr Misango&#39;s house and the bees had made it their home for 10 years.&quot;I can&#39;t tell exactly what transpired because these bees have been in the ceiling for 10 years without causing any problems for people or livestock,&quot; said Martin Kumbo who witnessed the incident.&quot;But when the hawk hit the hive, the bees swarmed out and began stinging everyone in the compound. They first attacked Misango&#39;s son and when he came out to help, they turned on him,&quot; he said.His wife, Susan Misango, who rushed into the house and came out with a blanket to protect her husband, is in hospital nursing severe injuries.ALLERGIC REACTIONMedics at Kakamega County Referral hospital where the family was taken for treatment said Misango died from a severe allergic reaction to the bee stings.Ms&nbsp;Misango and her two children are still recuperating at the facility.&quot;The patients have localised pain and reddish swellings on the body but they are responding well to medication,&quot; said a medic.Seven of Misango&#39;s cows were also stung but two workers said they saved them from further harm by pouring paraffin on them.&quot;One calf was stung so many times that it cannot chew,&quot; said one worker.The bees buzzed around the homestead for hours, forcing a group of Christians who visited the home to condole with the family to hold prayers outside the gate.A number of elders claimed a supernatural force was behind the incident, which they described as rare. They said according to Luhya culture, bees do not sting aged men.&quot;Since my childhood, this has never happened in Ebuhahi village. Bees are known to sting boys who provoke them but not the elderly. I am aware of the tales that bees are &#39;sent&#39; to sting people and we will look into that,&quot; said Gibson Omwera, one of the elders.According to a health worker, people who stay close to bees or who rear them in their homesteads and have a severe allergy to their stings must keep adrenaline injections on stand-by.
