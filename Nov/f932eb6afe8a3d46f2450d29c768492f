Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i is among Government officials supervising this year&#39;s national examinations.Dr Matiang&#39;i witnessed head teachers collect examination papers at the Emuhaya education offices in Luanda as the exams kicked off smoothly.Later, the CS proceeded to Kilingili Primary, Mbale Shalom Academy and Chango Primary schools within Vihiga County, where he oversaw administration of the tests. He arrived at Kilingili Primary School at 6.30 am and witnessed the opening of mathematics papers before proceeding to Mbale Shalom Academy.Other senior officials supervising the exams are Kenya National Examinations Council chairman George Magoha who is in Nairobi. All the three Education principal secretaries are in various regions.This came as Coast Regional Co-ordinator Nelson Marwa banned a programme where Standard Eight and Form Four candidates&nbsp;are given lunch by the county government and other local leaders during national examinations.This sparked off protests among a section of county leaders, especially those who had delivered packed food to the candidates.For the last three years, the Mombasa county government has provided food, including milk, for all exam candidates in public schools. Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, who has been part of the programme, said he learned on Monday that they would not be allowed to feed the candidates.Mr Marwa said he banned the food programme as a way of implementing a Government directive meant to check exam irregularities.&quot;This is in line with the stringent new guidelines to contain rampant cheating that has compromised the integrity of exams in the past,&quot; said Marwa.&quot;We have intelligence that there is an attempt to steal the exam through these dubious programmes and if people are not careful, they will be arrested,&quot; he warned.&nbsp;DONATED FOODHe dismissed claims by those who had donated food that they were not notified of the ban in good time and that they had incurred massive losses.&quot;Everyone was aware of the ban. It is the duty of parents to prepare their children from the moment they wake up on the day of exams. That duty should not be left to politicians just to gain mileage,&quot; Marwa said.Some 16,716 candidates are sitting the KCPE examinations in both public and private schools in the county.&nbsp;Education Executive Tendai Lewa said the county government had already bought food for all the candidates by the time they were learning about the ban. He said sub-county education officers and head teachers yesterday refused to receive food, citing Marwa&#39;s directive.Meanwhile, candidates at Ojamii Primary School in Teso South sub-county had to endure funeral loud music from two neighbouring homes as they tackled their first paper. County Director of Education Dickson Ogonya and local administration police officers had to intervene.&quot;The music was too loud; even the locals were complaining. What shocked us was that a boy who was playing the music told us he was not aware of the ongoing examinations,&quot; said Mr Ogonya, who added that no reports of cheating or delays had been recorded in the area so far.In Busia County, 10,159 candidates are sitting the exams under enhanced security.In Kericho, Toroton chief Richard Koech said a candidate from Kipteris Primary School in Chilchila ward, Kipkelion West constituency, was arrested after he allegedly stabbed a 21-year-old man. The two reportedly fought over a girl on Monday night.&quot;The candidate did not turn up for the exams and we caught up with him in the morning as he attempted to flee,&quot; said Mr Koech.Two examination centres in Elgeyo Marakwet had to be moved to nearby schools due to insecurity.
