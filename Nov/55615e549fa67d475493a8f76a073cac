The cohesion agency wants initiates undergoing communal rites of passages to be taught national values.Commissioner Belinda Ochiel from the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) said the initiative would encourage co-existence among diverse groups. She said most communities had high regard for their rites of passage and enriching such ceremonies would be highly effective.&quot;Using culture to promote national integration is a sure way of making sure that all are reached accordingly,&quot; Ms Ochiel said&nbsp;at the weekend during the 16th edition of the Cultural Festival at Kaimosi Teachers Training College.She added: &quot;Most youths after they have been initiated, become either responsible or irresponsible citizens depending on what they are taught while undergoing the process.&quot;Ochiel said plans were under way to reach out to groups such as the Tiriki and Bukusu through their month-long traditional circumcision ceremonies.She warned youths against being hired by politicians to help them deal with their competitors during electioneering.&quot;While holding politicians responsible for any polarisation messages spread across various communities, the youths used will equally be held responsible,&quot; she said.She noted the commission had set out to reach as many youths as possible through events such as performance arts and village theatres to teach national values.Students from different communities at the college showcased their rich cultural heritage.The event was also attended by National Police Service Commission Chairperson Johnston Kavuludi, Hamisi MP Charles Gimose and County Director of Education Siloma Kinayia.Kavuludi urged students to be ambassadors for change while outside the institution, noting that the country cannot rely on politicians.Mr Kinayia pointed out that such cultural performances help to bridge the inter-communal gap.&quot;The 42 tribes in the country should not be our greatest enemy but rather help us to propel our interests together,&quot; he said.College principal Onzere Mudangale said this year&#39;s cultural festival had been tailored towards next year&#39;s General Election, noting that teaching national values to students and the neighbouring community would help them tolerate each other.
