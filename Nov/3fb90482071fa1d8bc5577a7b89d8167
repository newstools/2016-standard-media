&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} Hanoi:A fire that broke out at a karaoke lounge in Vietnam&#39;s capital killed at least 13 people, the government said on Wednesday, in a rare accident of its kind for which the prime minister demanded an investigation and punishment for safety violations. The fire started around lunchtime on Tuesday in a crowded residential area on the outskirts of Hanoi and flames quickly spread to engulf three neighboring houses as clouds of black smoke filled the air, a Reuters witness said. It took more than two hours for fire teams to put out the flames to allow rescuers to start searching for victims, the government said in a statement on Wednesday. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc &quot;instructed Hanoi police to soon investigate and find the cause as well as to deal strictly with any violations,&quot; the government said in an earlier statement. Phuc also asked Hanoi city government to close down karaoke parlors and restaurants which fail to observe fire preventive measures.
