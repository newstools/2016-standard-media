If you live in a glass house, goes the saying, you should not throw stones. For one house on sale in New York, the saying extends to wearing clothes full-time. The giant glass-and-steel box for sale in East Hampton, NY, needs a special buyer who wants to live in a human terrarium, reports realtor.com. The price? $5.5 million (Sh550 million). The 5,000-square-foot house sits on nearly two acres and backs up to a 20-acre nature reserve, so the floor-to-ceiling glass walls look upon all variety of flora and fauna. It was built by Juan A. Figueroa, who lived in the house briefly last summer but never planned to make it his forever home, the listing agent is quoted as saying. The agent says the house, which officially hit the market last week, is already attracting artists because of the great light. It has also caught the interest of a few tech guys, because it&rsquo;s a smart house controlled by a smartphone. The first floor includes an entertainment area, dining space, and kitchen with white counters sitting on chocolate-brown cabinets. A wall of windows opens onto a concrete patio and a saltwater pool with spa. The second floor features two wings: one with two master suites, and the other with four en suite bedrooms. The basement, which connects to the house through a tunnel, features a four-car garage and storage space that could become a media room. Any takers?
