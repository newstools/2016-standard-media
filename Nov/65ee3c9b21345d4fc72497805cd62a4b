President Uhuru Kenyatta has intensified efforts to support&nbsp; Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed&#39;s quest for the African Union (AU) chairperson&#39;s slot.State House yesterday said Ms Mohammed and fellow Cabinet secretaries will engage in an elaborate campaign across the continent to sell her candidature to African counties.&quot;In the coming weeks, Amb Mohammed, as well as her colleagues in the Cabinet, will fan across the continent as special envoys to campaign for her,&quot; said State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu. President Kenyatta last week briefed Kenyan ambassadors on the country&#39;s approach to lobbying for the position.&quot;Last week, Kenya formally launched the candidature of Mohammed as chairperson of the African Union Commission at a State House event attended by African ambassadors and high commissioners accredited to Kenya, as well as all Kenyan ambassadors and high commissioners serving in Africa,&quot; said Mr Esipisu.Delegations from Somalia said the country had offered its vote to the CS, making it the first country to do so.&quot;President Kenyatta himself remains very steadfast about the candidature, having nominated Mohammed after wide consultations with many African Heads of State and Governments. He will continue to consult his colleagues directly as he seeks consensus on the candidature,&quot; added the briefing.Esipisu said the CS has a wealth of experience for the job.
