Rongai MP Raymond Moi has defended President Uhuru Kenyatta over corruption in the Jubilee government and asked officers mentioned in suspect deals to step aside.Raymond said individuals mentioned in corruption allegations are tainting the president&rsquo;s image and should take a bold step and resign. &ldquo;President Uhuru is a clean person, he is a person of integrity and we don&rsquo;t want his name to be tainted. So those corrupt individuals should carry their own cross,&rdquo; he said.Raymond was speaking during the distribution of Uwezo Funds cheques to groups at Kamp ya Moto trading centre in Rongai. He was accompanied by Fund Director Stanley Michuki. The legislator said President Kenyatta has done a lot to transform the country and claimed that only a few corrupt individuals in the government are tarnishing his name.&ldquo;We support the President in his bid to clean up the government,&rdquo; he said.His sentiments were echoed by Michuki who reiterated that there are dishonest individuals in the government.Raymond said Kanu will not merge with Jubilee, but will support President Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election next year.&ldquo;I am in Kanu, but that does not mean I&rsquo;m in the Opposition. We supported Uhuru since 2002 when many people rejected him, we backed him in 2013 and will do the same in 2017. It is not a must that Kanu merges with jubilee and I don&rsquo;t see any problem there,&rdquo; he said.The MP distributed cheques worth over Sh7 million to 79 groups of youth, women and people living with disability. Michuki regretted that out of the Sh17 million disbursed in the constituency, only Sh2 million went to youth groups. He urged the youth to form groups so they can get the funds.He congratulated Raymond for &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; distribution of the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) that enabled Rongai to be voted one of the best in managing the kitty in the South Rift.Raymond urged the groups to spend the money to uplift their lives.
