ELDORET, KENYA: The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) has bought 67,000 bags of maize from farmers in North Rift region with long queues building up, a week after it opened doors for current season&#39;s supplies. The cereals board has also purchased more than 110,000 bags of wheat over the last one month to support wheat producers who have been facing market challenges due to imports. Mr Joseph Tuwei, the NCPB acting regional manager North Rift said 10 depots were fully operational adding that they take about 50 lorries of produce delivered by farmers every day. &quot;We receive an average grain loads in 50 lorries each day and more farmers are lining up in respective depots that include Eldoret, Lessos, Mosoriot, Kipkaren River, Kipkaren Salient, Turbo, Ziwa, Mois Bridge, Kitale and Kapenguria. Three more depots &ndash;Kapsowar, Kipkabus and Kapsowar are yet to open because farmers in the regions have not harvested,&quot; said Tuwei. The official said farmers who supply the produce have been vetted by zonal agricultural officials and administrators to ensure that produce are only bought from genuine farmers who are paid Sh 3,000 for each 90 kg bag for both maize and wheat. &quot;There is a list of registered farmers and we advise all producers to go through it. If their names are missing, we advise them to see their respective zonal agricultural officials and ensure they are enlisted with the ministry,&quot; said Tuwei. The cereals board, he added, is receiving produce from farmers before repackaging it in standardized NCPB branded 50 kg bags before the Strategic Food Reserves (SFRs) is stored in the board&#39;s warehouse.
