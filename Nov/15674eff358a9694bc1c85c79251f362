Police officers have complained about their medical insurance scheme, claiming that they are being turned away from health facilities.This comes one month after the Government announced that police and prison officers, their spouses and children would receive free healthcare provided by AAR as the lead insurer and four other companies. AON Minet is the administrator of the new scheme.Those affected said hospitals were turning them away and that they had sought help from AON Minet offices in Nairobi in vain. &quot;We are being turned away from some hospitals and NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund) doesn&#39;t want to address our cases. The new scheme is not working for us,&quot; said one officer who visited AON offices.The scheme was launched on October 1.Police authorities have acknowledged there were challenges in implementing the new Sh18 billion scheme. A similar scheme provided by NHIF at Sh4 billion annually was stopped.A dispatch from police headquarters to commanders said Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet had received information that officers were facing difficulties in accessing services owing to problems associated with switching from the old insurance provider.&quot;We have taken up the matter with the consortium who have pledged to expedite the transition phase and ensure that the hitches associated with mobile registration are eliminated,&quot; read part of the dispatch signed by Stanley Lemai, the head of personnel.Police headquarters later provided registration forms with instructions. However, officers in remote areas have complained that they had not been able to register.The new scheme caters for evacuation of injured officers from any part of East Africa.The lowest ranked officer, a constable, is insured at Sh150,000 for outpatient and Sh1.5 million for inpatient services every year.The highest ranked officer is insured at Sh500,000 for outpatient and Sh5 million for inpatient services.The new scheme covers a 107,000-strong workforce.
