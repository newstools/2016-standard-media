The fate of a man who hacked his brother to death while protecting his elderly mother will be decided on November 30. The accused, Francis Kirugu got a reprieve after High Court Judge Hatari Waweru cleared him of the murder count, but found him guilty of causing grievous harm to his brother Stephen Maina who later succumbed to injuries. &quot;From the evidence adduced, the deceased had a jembe handle which the accused managed to grab from him. But evidence indicate that you hit him when he was on the ground after you freed yourself,&quot; said the judge. The accused was defending his mother Peninah Wambui Mwangi, now 76 years old who was being beaten by his elder brother who was drunk. The incident happened on the night of October 16, 2010 at Nguthuru village in Kandara.
