Wiper Party MPs downplayed fears of a fallout after Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s public spat with Senator Johnstone Muthama. Kathiani MP Robert Mbui, his Matungulu counterpart Stephen Mule and Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr yesterday argued that reports that Kalonzo had branded Muthama &#39;the enemy within&#39; had been blown out of proportion. Kalonzo is reported to have given Muthama a public dressing-down during the Wiper Party caravan along Mombasa road, accusing him of sabotage. &quot;I am fully aware of what you have been doing behind my back with senator (James) Orengo to predetermine the outcome of CORD&#39;s presidential primaries and deny me the ticket. You must convince Wiper supporters that the ticket you are pushing for can deliver victory for CORD,&quot; Kalonzo is quoted to have told Muthama at the Sultan Hamud rally. FUELING DIVISIONS The Wiper party leader is further said to have accused Muthama of triggering divisions within the party and engaging in utterances which border on bullying other party followers.

The whole issue has been over hyped,&quot; said Mutula Jnr. Mutula noted Kalonzo only corrected Muthama on &#39;an issue relating to smaller parties in Ukambani.&#39; Mr Mbui said Muthama, being a key pillar in the party would not deliberately do anything to jeopardise its unity. &quot;There is no doubt Muthama has the interest of the party at heart and certainly he will reflect strongly on what the party leader told him,&quot; he said. But speaking separately to The Standard, Mbooni MP Kisoi Munyao, who decamped to Jubilee Party from Wiper, seemed to agree with Kalonzo. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
