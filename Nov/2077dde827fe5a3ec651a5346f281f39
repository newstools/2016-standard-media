Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s supporters have challenged Americans turn out in large numbers next Tuesday to vote, warning that failure to do so will automatically give Donald Trump an edge in the US Presidential Polls. &nbsp; As the two Presidential nominees pitched tent in the swing vote States for last minute campaigns to woo undecided voters to elect them, Clinton&rsquo;s team was in Virginia led by her opponent for the Democratic party ticket former Maryland Governor Martin O&rsquo;Malley. Similar to Trump&rsquo;s team in the area also busy seeking voters in regions predominantly Democrats, they urged their supporters to ensure their cast the ballot of the elections Day. But for O&rsquo;Malley, his message to the American voters is that Trump and Clinton are campaigning on a contract platform and the issues dear to each is light day and night. &ldquo;I continue to call upon the voters to ensure they turn out to cast their ballot.&nbsp; Not voting is voting for Trump. Only those who don&rsquo;t believe in the American vision will want to stay home,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Malley of the undecided voters who have threatened to boycott the exercise. He continued, &ldquo;This election is about choice of freedom or fascism. It&rsquo;s about keeping President Barrack Obama&rsquo;s legacy alive. It&rsquo;s about the future. Anybody with sane mind would not want Trump in office.&rdquo; READ MORE Trump, Clinton blast each other on character; Clinton rises in poll Campaign finance regulations to promote transparency, case of Kenya and US U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears He went ahead to argue that going by how low Republican endorsement of Trump has taken American politics to the &lsquo;dogs&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s up to the voters to ensure sanity prevails and this can only be realized through the ballot. He said the country has gone through serious struggles and needs a focused leader. &ldquo;Comparing the candidates, Trump is too high while Clinton is too low. Clinton is advancing issues dear to the common America like equal pay for equal work, job growth, labour laws, the criminal justice system, climate change which is both a threat and business and Medicare,&rdquo; outlined O&rsquo;Malley. On the other hand, the former governor advocates for things that are just way off. &nbsp;&ldquo;There is a clear striking difference between Trump and Clinton. Trump should have not clinched the party ticket of a major party.&nbsp; He should have been a third candidate in this race,&rdquo; stated O&rsquo;Malley. He warned that a Trump presidency will spell doom for America, while Clinton&rsquo;s presidency is guaranteed continuation of ongoing policies both domestic and foreign. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
