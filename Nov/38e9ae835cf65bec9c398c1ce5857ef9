Muslim clerics and Board of trustees Kakamega Jamia Mosque have asked their faithful to be patient until a court case withholding elections of the mosque&#39;s managers is heard and determined. The mosque&#39;s spiritual head Imam Ibrahim Sadala and board of trustee members Salim Mohamed, Rashid Nasoro and Mohamed Juma have for the past two months faced vicious opposition from a section of faithful. The faithfuls last week poured on the streets demanding they vacate office over favouritism and corruption allegations including selling of the mosque&#39;s land. &quot;We have no problem with holding an election to usher in new board members and a new Imam. If anything were it not for the court case contesting elections we would have had a new office sitting this year,&quot; said chair of board of trustee Nasaro. They dismissed allegations that they had sold a parcel off the mosque&#39;s land saying the mosque located at Kambi Somali-Kakamega had no tittle deed like all the plots in the neighbourhood. &quot;We have nonetheless not tempered with the borders of the mosque land which we inherited from the past management board of the mosque in 2011 when we assumed office. If anyone has evidence on the contrary he is free to bring it up,&quot; said Ibrahim Sadala (pictured) lead preacher at the mosque.
