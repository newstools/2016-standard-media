Nyandarua county deputy Governor Mwangi Kirika has criticized the move by a section of elected leaders to hold meetings for the newly formed Jubilee Party outside the county.He said that for the party meetings to have legal authenticity, they should be held within the county so as also to include the views of local residents.Waithaka said that all leaders should be involved in the picking of the new interim officials questioning on why a section of leaders were holding the meetings in other counties. He was referring directly to a meeting held in Nakuru by Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho on Wednesday and another one held by his Kipipiri counterpart Mburu Kinyanjui in Naivasha where they were strategizing on who would take over the running of the party.&quot;I am questioning the legal authenticity of these meetings since they are being held outside the county. I want the leaders to explain to the Nyandarua people why they are not holding the meetings within the county.It like running the affairs of the country in Uganda.&quot; said Kirika.He claimed that the meetings were being held outside the county with an ill motive so as to elect their cronies to be the interim officials of the party.&quot;We are sensing danger that they are grooming their cronies to lead the party and that is why they want to exclude the views of the common mwananchi by holding the meeting in exclusive hotels in Nakuru,&quot; he observed.The deputy Governor vowed that the residents would not allow this to happen.&quot;We will not allow officials to be imposed on us after they are elected by non-existent party members in hotels. I want to urge the common mwananchi not to allow party leaders not to be imposed on them and instead elect them in a legal manner,&quot; he said.The Deputy Governor who is eying the gubernatorial seat regretted that the residents were not being involved in the running of the new party by a section of elected leaders who were instead dictating to them on who the interim officials would be.Efforts by The Standard to get comments from both Kiaraho and Mburu were futile as they did not respond to our calls.
