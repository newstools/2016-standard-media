Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has criticised Opposition leader Raila Odinga for portraying the Jubilee government as corrupt.The CS also faulted Raila for waging persistent attacks on government projects, including those commissioned when he served as the country&rsquo;s Prime Minister during the coalition government.Speaking yesterday during a tour of Kimama water station in Mt Elgon Constituency Bungoma County, Mr Wamalwa said: &ldquo;The CORD leader should stop acting like a sniper by shooting down all Vision 2030 projects, especially the water initiatives.&rdquo; He said politicising projects launched by the Grand Coalition to taint the Jubilee administration would not stop the government from rolling out and funding such projects.&ldquo;We will not be distracted by politics of machinations and intimidation. Playing with water projects is like playing with the lives of Kenyans who need it,&rdquo; the CS said.Wamalwa disclosed that the Itare Dam water supply project, which was established in the 1990s, was intended to serve over one million residents of Nakuru and Kericho counties. It was commissioned by the former PM during his tenure to a tune of Sh100,000, said the CS.&ldquo;We are surprised that during the coalition government, they signed an agreement with the Italian Prime Minister to kick-start the construction of&nbsp; the Itare water project. We are working on it because it has stalled. How then to do you come up with wild allegations that we are using the &lsquo;secret water project to siphon money,&rdquo; posed Wamalwa.Wamalwa has also faulted Raila over his claims that the&nbsp;&nbsp; government was out to siphon funds meant for the construction of the Northern water tunnel in Murang&rsquo;a County, which will support the Ndakaini dam and eventually serve over 140,000 Nairobi County residents.The CS has now called on the ODM party leader to stop selectively attacking projects started by the Grand Coalition government and instead support the current government in realising Jubilee&rsquo;s campaign pledges.
