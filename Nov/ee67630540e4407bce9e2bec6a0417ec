President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s campaign team has moved to allay fears that they will use their positions to undermine their rivals in the polls.National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, his counterpart in the Senate, Kithure Kindiki, and nominated MP Johnson Sakaja said those in the presidential national re-election campaign would not use their positions to the disadvantage of their opponents.They said the selection of the team should not be interpreted as an endorsement by the two leaders ahead of party primaries. &quot;Anybody who uses his position to undermine opponents in the party does not deserve to serve on the campaign team,&quot; the leaders said.Some Jubilee Party aspirants on Friday protested the naming of their rivals to campaign team positions that were unveiled by Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto.The President unveiled a 61-member team to steer his national campaign. The team is headed by former Cabinet minister Raphael Tuju.Prof Kindiki said the appointment only came with the responsibility to sell the Jubilee agenda; it had no political privileges.&quot;The disquiet over the appointment of the committee is normal and I understand why. But my request to party supporters is to understand that only a few people can serve on the committee. Not everybody can be there. However, being part of the committee does not confer any special privileges,&quot; he said.&quot;In fact, those on the committee will be forced to sacrifice and go out of their way to bring everyone on board. The burden is greater on those inside than those outside.&quot;Mr Sakaja, who is running for the Nairobi governorship, said more people would be picked to run county campaign teams.He noted that anyone planning to use their position to champion an individual agenda did not deserve to be part of the national campaign team.&quot;Look at Nairobi; all of us (governor hopefuls) are on the team. It is not an endorsement but a responsibility to campaign for the President and his deputy,&quot; said Sakaja.
