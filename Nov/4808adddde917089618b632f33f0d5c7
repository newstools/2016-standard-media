Tharaka Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa now wants Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to intervene and improve his security detail after unknown people threatened him through text message that they are after his head. Speaking on Sunday, at Marimanti Catholic Church, Ragwa also went ahead to ask the Catholic faithful to include him in their prayer list as he felt unsafe. He said he needs&nbsp;a technical security team of experts from the Recce squad that guards the VVIP&#39;s, including armoured vehicles and spies. He said the attackers have even gone to an extent of intercepting his way to his home in Meru County. Ragwa said that he received a message where the sender threatened to chop off his head within two months and that he will not be in the ballot during next year&rsquo;s general elections. He said in the last two months people have been hunting him and his deputy Eliud Mate, to an extent of invading their homes at night. &ldquo;People have been saying that we will not be in the ballot, we wonder what they know. One of my workers was hit during Deputy President&rsquo;s tour and he has since recorded statement, another one had his both hands broken early this month for defending me,&rdquo; he said.
