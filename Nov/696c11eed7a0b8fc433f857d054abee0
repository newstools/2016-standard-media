The county government is set to automate revenue collection in all health facilities. Governor Samuel Tunai has raised concern over loopholes in revenue collection in the county&#39;s health sector, saying automation will ensure maximum collection of revenue.Speaking during an impromptu visit to Narok County Hospital where he inspected the new renal, X-ray and dialysis building, the county chief revealed that equipment will soon be installed at the new facility. He said apart from automation of revenue collection, biometric machines and CCTV surveillance would be installed to monitor health workers&#39; arrival time as well as how patients are being handled.&quot;For many years, our people have been seeking dialysis, x-rays and some surgeries at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret but this will soon be a thing of the past,&quot; said Tunai. He said his administration was set to expand the hospital from the current 170-bed capacity to 300.&nbsp;The governor urged the hospital management to come up with a master plan to ensure effectiveness in infrastructure development.
