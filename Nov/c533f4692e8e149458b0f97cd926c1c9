ODM rebels will not be struck off the party&#39;s membership register until an appeal they have filed is determined.One governor, a deputy governor and seven MPs would have lost their membership today at the expiry of a seven-day deadline for the Registrar of Political Parties to remove the expelled members from the register.Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&#39;u yesterday said they will wait for the outcome of the appeal, an indication of a long-drawn-out legal battle between the rebels and the party. ODM is pushing for by-elections to replace the leaders, yet the law bars the electoral agency from holding mini polls 90 days to a General Election. Those targeted include former ODM Secretary General Ababu Namwamba, Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Kwale Woman Rep Zainab Chidzuga, and MPs John Waluke (Sirisia) and Samuel Arama (Nakuru West).
