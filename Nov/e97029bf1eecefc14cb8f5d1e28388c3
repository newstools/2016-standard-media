Health services are set to resume in Nyeri County after the court ordered striking medical staff to go back to work.Doctors have been on strike for the last three weeks to press for promotions among other demands.Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union branch chairman Wanderi Kamau confirmed their members will go back to work as ordered by the court. &ldquo;We are law abiding citizens and that is why we will respect the decision of the court,&rdquo; he said.Dr Wanderi said: &quot;We understand there is a court order that had been issued saying we should resume our duties and we have informed our members accordingly as we now prepare for the hearing of the case on Tuesday November 8.&rdquo;He, however, said the union would continue to agitate until the county government meets their demands.&quot;The county government has not been serious in addressing our demands. They have continued changing goal posts during our negotiations which is very unfortunate,&quot; said Wanderi.The union wants all medical consultants promoted. It also wants more doctors hired to address the shortage in public health facilities in the county.
