HIV patients have appealed for relief food, saying famine in the region had affected their therapy.A local hospital has offered to give them food supplements.Recently, a group of HIV patients stormed the office of Health Executive Mary Ekai and threatened to abandon anti-retroviral drugs. Ms Ekai said one child had died in Samburu as a result of malnutrition caused by the ongoing famine in the county.&quot;The worst affected are those living with HIV, women and children,&quot; said a resident.The county official noted there was need for decisions to be made as fast as possible to prevent more deaths from starvation and malnutrition.&quot;According to a survey, three out of 10 children are facing malnutrition and the situation is expected to worsen because schools have closed yet many children depend on meals offered by learning institutions,&quot; said Ekai.She said feeding centres will soon be set up in various towns to assist children below the age of five.
