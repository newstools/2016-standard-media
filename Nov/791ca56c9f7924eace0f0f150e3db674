Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau last evening secured a court order allowing him to launch his manifesto at Mumbi grounds in Murang&rsquo;a County. With that, Kamau can now hold the much-publicised event at the local field to launch his Murang&rsquo;a County gubernatorial bid. This marks the end of a tumultuous week for the two-time legislator who had to fight with the county officials to secure the grounds after his request to use the bigger Ihura Stadium was rejected. Last week, workers putting final touches at the venue were thrown into a spin after two residents obtained a court order stopping the event. Resident magistrate Jesse Masiga restrained the convenors of the meeting from holding it after two residents expressed fears that it will trigger chaos among warring factions. Dennis Gachanja and Harrison Mwangi Gatitu were ordered to serve the orders to Murang&rsquo;a County Commissioner John Elungata, Murang&rsquo;a County government and the Kigumo MP.

The County commissioner&rsquo;s office declined to accept the court order while Murang&rsquo;a County secretary Patrick Mukuria received it on behalf of Governor Mwangi wa Iria. Last week, there was a confrontation between the police and a section of the youth over the same grounds. Kamau had earlier sought permission from the county government to use General Ihura Stadium but there was no feedback from Murang&rsquo;a town manager Jeremiah Kamau.
