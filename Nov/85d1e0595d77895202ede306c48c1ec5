Kanu leaders have expressed support for the criticism of the Government&#39;s laxity in the war against corruption.Speaking at Kaibos, West Pokot Senator John Loyangapuo and Civil Aviation Authority Chairman Samuel Poghisio said CORD had managed to put the Government on its toes by ensuring public funds are not misappropriated. &quot;The Government should allow CORD to perform its duties. In every country, there must be an opposition that acts as a watchdog to the Government,&quot; said Lonyangapuo.The two said CORD had helped save taxpayers&#39; money and asked the Government to give it cooperation to enable it to carry out its mandate.This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta accused the Opposition of politicising the war against corruption to tarnish his Government&#39;s name.The leaders said although Kanu supported Uhuru, it will not merge with the new Jubilee Party.&quot;Kanu doesn&#39;t have a presidential candidate and we shall support Uhuru for the presidency,&quot; said Lonyangapuo.
