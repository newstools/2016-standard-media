Findings of a new audit at the Ministry of Health will be released in one week.Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu yesterday told the Senate Health Committee, investigating the alleged loss of billions of shillings at the ministry, that an audit of the ministry&#39;s coffers was launched last week.Mailu insisted that the loss of funds had not been ascertained so far; and that auditors from the National Treasury were working on a fresh audit. &quot;Last Friday, we enlisted the support of the audit unit from the Treasury. In the course of the week, they will give us a report of their findings, which we shall share with the public,&quot; he said.He maintained that the amount of money in question in the interim audit report is not Sh5.2 billion as claimed but Sh3.1 billion.&quot;It is important not to leave this matter to speculation, when we get the report, we shall share the outcome,&rdquo; he said.Mailu promised to table the final audit report before the house team next Tuesday.During yesterday&#39;s session, the CS admitted that his deputy, Dr Nicholas Muraguri, had earlier requested for the transfer of the ministry&#39;s Internal Auditor-Bernard Muchere, the man behind the interim audit report that caused public outrage after it was leaked to the media.Mailu said Muraguri wrote to his colleague at the Treasury requesting the transfer of the Internal Auditor in July, hardly three months after the official had reported to the ministry.The Senate committee heard that Treasury CS Henry Rotich rejected the proposal to move the auditor, insisting in a letter dated October 19, that the said officer would continue serving until the end of the month.However, Muraguri who appeared before the committee after Mailu seemed to contradict his boss when he told the senators that he was not behind the push to have the internal auditor transferred.&quot;What I asked for was for a more competent person to be sent to the ministry, somebody more senior. I never asked for transfer of the auditor,&quot; said Muraguri.The two top health officials who appeared separately before the committee, dismissed reports that Sh586 million may have been paid to ghost companies and individuals, saying that owners of the firms can still be held accountable if there was any irregularity.
