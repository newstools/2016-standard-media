Baringo Senator Gideon Moi yesterday hit out at Deputy President William Ruto for falsely accusing him and Bomet Governor of being agents of division among the Kalenjin. Gideon said the Kalenjin rallied behind Ruto in 2013 yet the DP was now busy intimidating and abusing the same community. &quot;He has been accusing us of being agents of division but in the real sense he is the one who is sowing division by unnecessarily targeting leaders from the community who speak their mind,&quot; said the senator. He said the 2017 election will be an opportunity for the community to chart its political direction. Gideon dismissed calls by the DP for the community to remain in Jubilee to ascend to power in 2022. &quot;It is only by the grace of God that we will reach 2022. And before that, we should voice our needs and demand development from the Government through a vote in 2017,&quot; Gideon said.
