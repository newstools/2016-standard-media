Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) rebels at the Coast remained defiant even after their expulsion from the party.MPs Gideon Mung&#39;aro (Kilifi North) and Mustafa Iddi (Kilifi South), the only rebels from the region spared the axe, are expected to face the ODM disciplinary committee today.But Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Kwale Woman Representative Zainab Chidzuga and Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima who were expelled from ODM are fighting the punitive action. Mr Mung&#39;aro has declared he is prepared for any eventuality, adding that a by-election would be an opportunity to take on Raila.&quot;There will be no by-election. If it happens, I will know whether Raila Odinga is still strong. We are in Government and ODM should not play with us,&#39;&#39; said Mung&#39;aro.He accused the ODM leader of wasting time pursuing them and insisted that he is still in ODM as he has not made any official announcement declaring he has ditched the party.&quot;This has been a separation period. If there will be a divorce, the announcement will be made when the time comes,&#39;&#39; he said.Mung&#39;aro vowed to stand with those who have been expelled by his party as he awaits his lawyer&#39;s advice on whether to honour summonses by the ODM disciplinary committee.&quot;We shall follow the directions of our lawyer, and listen to his advice on whether to face the committee or not. I cannot be threatened. I will go to the panel if I get time,&quot; he added.Mung&#39;aro said Coast ODM rebels will fight for their rights and &quot;will go back to the people&quot; if the party expels them.Kwale Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani said she is ready to take over in the event her boss, Mr Mvurya, loses the seat.Ms Achani spoke in the company of Mvurya with the firm message that Mvurya&#39;s exit would not occasion a by-election.&quot;Those who think there will be a by-election are misguided. If the governor goes home, as his deputy I will take over so where will the by-election take place? Let them (aspirants) read the law well,&quot; Achani said at the County Government offices in Mvindeni on Tuesday evening.Mvurya declined to comment even after prodding from the journalists. Achani is a strong defender of Mvurya&#39;s policies.However, while addressing the public, Mvurya said he does not fear elections.&quot;We know elections will come next year and we don&#39;t fear anything. Today I will not say much but tell you that I will not be swayed by anyone,&quot; he said.He added: &quot;I am so happy that we have changed the county although some are causing rifts. I know some people are salivating for my seat but what I have said is that we are continuing to work for our people,&quot; the governor said.Achani termed the decision to expel the governor unfair.Very Popular&quot;In the disciplinary panel there was Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko who, even before the sitting, had already abused the governor in a rally held at this county so we can not expect the judgement to be fair,&quot; she said.Achani said Mvurya was still very popular in the county and they were ready to defend their positions together in the event of a by-election.Umoja Summit social media group yesterday declared support for Mvurya, alleging that he was targeted because of his performance, particularly in the water, health and education sectors.In a statement, the group&#39;s Mombasa co-ordinator Anthony Chitavi and members Michael Chiko, Sidi Kumbatha, Bakari Mfaume and Maureen Mwangovya claimed ODM did not have the interests of the Coast region at heart and that is why it targeted leaders like Mvurya, Mung&#39;aro, Idd and Chidzuga.&quot;We ask Coast people to see this divide and rule attempt for what it is; separating Mvurya, Chidzuga, Mwahima from Mung&#39;aro, Mustafa and (Khatib) Mwashetani,&quot; they said.Mwahima however said: &quot;I have decided to reserve my comments on the party decision. I have nothing to say about that please.&quot;Chidzuga promised to issue a statement but didn&#39;t.Mung&#39;aro and Iddi alongside James Rege (Karachuonyo), Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East) and Chachu Ganya (North Horr) were spared expulsion and directed to appear before the committee chaired by Fred Athuok.
