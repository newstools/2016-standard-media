Over 335 Embu County workers may lose their jobs following a High Court ruling that declared their employment null and void. The affected workers were employed during the time when County Public Service Board chairman Mundia Gateria had been interdicted. The Labour and Employment Court in Nyeri yesterday declared all decisions, actions and proceedings made by the county board during the period when Mr Gateria was not in office null and void. Judge Byram Ongaya in a ruling on November 20 last year overturned the interdiction and ordered his reinstatement. Justice Ongaya further ordered Governor Martin Wambora to pay Gateria Sh5 million in compensation and an additional Sh2 million that he had demanded. In a submission filed in court yesterday, the county government said if the judgement was to be effected, all the employees hired during the time would lose their jobs.
