Gusii political leaders on Friday skipped a meeting convened by the Gusii Elders Council.Only Kisii Governor James Ongwae and two MCAs from Kisii attended the meeting that was chaired by&nbsp;council chairman James Matundura&nbsp;at the Kisii National Polytechnic. All MPs and MCAs from both Nyamira and Kisii counties had been invited. The over 200 elders drawn from both counties criticised politicians whom they said had developed a habit of misusing the electorate.They accused MPs for failing to tackle challenges facing the community more so in the agricultural sector.Mr Matundura said local leaders should embrace consultation in initiating development projects, adding that the leaders cannot work in isolation.On politics at funeral services, he said: &quot;Politicking in funerals by leaders is the height of disrespect to the dead and the bereaved families. Some politicians have even gone ahead to fight before the dead.&quot;He added: &quot;We have had so many instances where goons fought in funerals in the name of politics. African funerals were a solemn affair that deserved extreme respect. All leaders no matter what must abide by that.&quot;Kisii Matutu Owners Association Chairman George Nyariki said politicians should explain to the electorate why they had not actualised their campaign pledges.
