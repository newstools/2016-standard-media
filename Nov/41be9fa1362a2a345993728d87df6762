Police raided an illegal gas filling station in Nakuru Town and seized 900 assorted gas cylinders, nine vehicles and arrested 14 suspects. The Monday evening raid was staged following a tip off from the public who complained the yard was being used for the business illegally. The suspects are expected in court Tuesday to face charges. Head of Special Crimes Prevention Unit Noah Katumo says the yard has been involved in the business without approvals from various agencies. &ldquo;We are interrogating the suspects arrested for more information on their operations,&rdquo; said Katumo. This comes in the wake of revelations that there are many filling stations operating in the area illegally. Energy Regulation Commission (ERC) officials have been complaining of the mushrooming of such yards.
