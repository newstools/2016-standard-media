More than 400 police&nbsp;officers&nbsp;have been promoted to the rank of senior superintendent of police.The National Police Service Commission announced the promotions, saying they were long overdue.The&nbsp;officers, who have been superintendents, included 220 from the Kenya Police, 96 from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and 94 from the Administration Police. Johnston Kavuludi, the NPSC boss said the&nbsp;officers&nbsp;deserved the promotions, which were announced in a memo sent to the concerned&nbsp;officers&nbsp;by their respective commanders.Among those promoted were Directorate of Criminal Investigation&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;(DCIOs). This means&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;Commanding Police Division (OCPDs) will have the same rank as DCIOs and APs at division level.Most OCPDs who were posted to newly-created divisions had not been promoted for almost two years, warranting the move, said Mr Kavuludi.&quot;Counties will be headed by&nbsp;officers&nbsp;holding the rank of commissioner of police while regional commanders will have the rank of assistant inspector general of police,&quot; he said.The issue of command has been a problem in the police service as most commanders hold the same rank. Traditionally, Kenya Police&nbsp;officers&nbsp;are in charge of their areas of command.Officers&nbsp;with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations will be referred to as detectives in a new scheme aimed at making the unit professional.A new scheme of service is yet to be launched and will have 14 police grades. It will be aligned with the mainstream civil service.Kavuludi said many police&nbsp;officers&nbsp;lagged behind in grading compared to other civil servants.&quot;When you compare their grading with those in the civil service, you realise they are junior,&quot; he said.
