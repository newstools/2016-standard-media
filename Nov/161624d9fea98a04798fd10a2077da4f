KISUMU: The Central Organization of Trade Unions (Cotu) has accused the Office of the Deputy President of pushing the union to name the political party it will back in the 2017 Election.The umbrella trade union said DP William Ruto&#39;s office was harassing heads of its affiliate parties in a bid to know who the workers&#39; body would front.Cotu&#39;s assistant Secretary General Ernest Nadome said Mr Ruto&#39;s office was illegally engaging officials of Cotu affiliated trade unions &quot;with the aim of discrediting its top brass&quot; and to split the labour movement. The union expressed concerns over reports that top leadership of a section of its affiliate unions were being approached directly by officials from Mr Ruto&#39;s office, flouting union structures.This, it says overlooks Cotu&#39;s role as the umbrella workers&#39; body in the country.Although the union did not disclose the kind of engagements the DP&#39;s office was making with its officials, Mr Nadome said Cotu was being pushed by the DP to declare the political party they support ahead of 2017 General Election.He said they had mandated Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli to engage all political parties on a neutral ground for the benefit of Kenyan workers but they were being pushed to name they preferred candidate.&quot;We want to tell the DP&#39;s office that we should not be pushed to declare a political party that we are going to support&quot; he said, &quot;We have always remained neutral but if the Jubilee Government does not style up to improve the situation in this country, we will have no option but to declare our political affiliation.&quot;Mr Nadome spoke during a press briefing in Kisumu Friday on behalf of Mr Atwoli who is in Geneva on an International Labour Organisation summit.He described the moves to engage Cotu affiliate parties directly as similar to those made by former Labour cabinet secretary Kazungu Kambi.&quot;The trade union movement world over is perceived to be free and independent of both government and employers...Cotu Kenya wishes to caution and equally appeal to the government to engage our affiliate unions with respect to laid down procedures ,&quot; said Nadome, Cotu&#39;s assistant secretary general.He said all correspondence should be channelled through the central body &quot;and with the full knowledge of the top leadership of our organization lest any attempts to the contrary be met by similar force.&quot;He added that Cotu is one the leading pressure groups in the country and would not yield to attempts by &#39;outside forces&#39; to split it.&quot;We strive to serve our members diligently through our affiliate trade unions and this virtue should not be construed to mean we can easily step down of feeble provocation as these forces within the Office of the DP are trying to. We will remain vigil and ready to protect our jurisdiction,&quot; he said.
