LAMU: Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has urged Coast residents to reject the Jubilee regime and rally behind the opposition.The former Deputy Prime Minister also called on the opposition to unite and oust the ruling coalition in next year&#39;s General Election.He was in Lamu County where he addressed rallies on Faza and Lamu islands in the Indian Ocean. Mudavadi described Jubilee as a kleptocracy that does not deserve to rule beyond one term. Mudavadi urged CORD leaders Kalonzo Musyoka, Raila Odinga and Moses Wetangula and other interested parties to support the idea of forming the National Super Alliance (NASA) to dislodge Jubilee out of power. Speaking in Lamu Saturday, Mudavadi claimed Jubilee had messed up the country, adding that President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto had condoned corruption in various government departments in the last four years.Mudavadi asked CORD leaders to embrace dialogue, saying NASA was the only way to easily remove the Jubilee administration from power.&quot;We want to cooperate under CORD to remove Jubilee from power,&#39;&#39; Mudavadi told hundreds of residents during a rally on Faza Island in Lamu East Sub county.He was accompanied by Lamu Governor Issa Timamy, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, Nambale MP Sakwa Bunyasi, ANC Deputy Party Leader Kassim Sawa Tandaza and MCA Mohamed Abasi.Mudavadi claimed Jubilee could no longer be trusted to lead the nation. &quot;What Kenyans witnessed during the Parliamentary Public Accountants Committee (PAC) sittings last week on the National Youth Service confirms corruption is all over in this government,&quot; he said in reference to allies of DP Ruto who were mentioned in connection with the scam.He said the mention of Ruto&#39;s allies by former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru showed corruption had penetrated the core of the Jubilee government. Mudavadi added that the Sh5 billion reportedly stolen from the Ministry of Health could be used to improve health standards but had ended up in the pockets of few individuals.Governor Timamy said he chose to remain with Mudavadi like he did in the 2013 polls because he stood by him during the difficult moments when he was arrested and held over the Mpeketoni terror attacks in 2014.&quot;I rejected Jubilee offer for ANC and Mudavadi. He did not get many votes in Lamu previously but we want locals to vote overwhelmingly for him this time,&#39;&#39; Timamy said.
