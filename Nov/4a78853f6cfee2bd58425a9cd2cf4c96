Up to October 8, Onyango Oloo was at the helm of one of the country&#39;s formidable political parties.He was the Secretary General of The National Alliance (TNA), President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s party. Eloquence, passionate defence of President Kenyatta, articulate pronouncement of Jubilee government&#39;s agenda and the pride of a Luo in occupying his position defined Mr Onyango.Today his political future hangs in the balance, thanks to the birth of Jubilee Party (JP). JP&#39;s structure left out the man who sacrificed to sell Jubilee Alliance ideologies where few dared to do, Nyanza.The few who had the courage held press conferences in Nairobi as the only way of communicating with the Luo Nyanza audience.But former Rarieda MP Raphael Tuju is turning out to be the next Luo Nyanza figure in JP.Last week Mr Tuju was named the head of Jubilee Party Secretariat. He is the only Luo in the nine-member team which also includes; Senators John Munyes (Turkana)&nbsp;and Beatrice Elachi (nominated), Governor Ken Lusaka (Bungoma) and MPs: Katoo ole Metito (Kajiado South), Sabina Chege (Murang&#39;a), Maina Kamanda (Kasarani), Gideon Mung&#39;aro (Kilifi North), Rachel Nyamai (Kitui South) and Mohamud Mohamed.This comes barely six months after Uhuru appointed Tuju to chair the Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA), taking over from Onyango whose three-year term at the parastatal was marred with political clash. His fellow Jubilee leaders were said to have had interests in the Sh3 billion LBDA Mall coming up in Kisumu&#39;s Mamboleo Estate.Tuju&#39;s name also appeared in the list of nine-man Jubilee Nyanza campaign team which also included; Charles Nyachae, Albert Nyaundi, Joash Maangi, Joash Nyamoko, Joseph Kiangoi, Walter Nyambati, Jimmy Angwenyi and Mathias Robi.The position puts Tuju as the face of Jubilee in Luo Nyanza, given that Onyango&#39;s name is missing in the new Jubilee Party structure. Onyango&#39;s political journey may be another case of from grass to grace and back.But Onyango is playing it cool saying there is no cause for alarm.He said politics is like a game of football where &quot;one plays in the bench or in the first squad&quot;, hence playing in the bench does not mean one is &quot;finished&quot;.Tuju said he was in the process of orientation and could not speak much on his new role in the party.
