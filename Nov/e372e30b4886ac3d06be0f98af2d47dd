As the curtain fell on the US presidential elections 2016 campaigns, foreign policy plans were drowned in the din of personal attacks between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Critics cited Republican presidential candidate Trump&#39;s campaign strategy that seemed to demonise America&#39;s relations with the rest of the world.Despite the incumbent President Barack Obama tracing his routes to Africa, Kenya to be precise, and his government being deeply involved in security situation in the Horn of Africa and other unstable nations, environmental issues and wildlife protection, appeared not of immediate priority to the candidates. Both campaigns devoted more to domestic issues such as the criminal justice system, racism, immigration laws, education, relationship with China and Russia among others.According to critics and political experts, Trump&#39;s foreign policy is more exclusive than inclusive and will go against its international treaties.&quot;The US debates have not focused on foreign policies because it was down their lists. This means that even though Clinton was a former Secretary of State, a continent like Africa was obviously not a priority at this point,&quot; said Prof Quentin Kidd, a political analyst at Christopher Newport University.He continued: &quot;Clinton has been seen as an extension of the Obama presidency for a third term and therefore those who resent his origin, since race has been a major component of these campaigns would not resonate with anything from that part of the world at the moment.&quot;He said this might spur an international crisis of some sort but going by the past leadership campaign trends, the candidates tend to take trips to countries in Europe, like Belgium and UK, and Israel, as opposed to Asia, the Middle East and Africa to seek allies.&quot;This year&#39;s presidential candidates have ignored everything even the Americans. They focused more on personal attacks not even addressing the domestic polices properly. This is a very unusual election,&quot; he faulted both Clinton and Trump.Former Maryland Governor and Democratic contender for the presidential ticket Martin O&#39;Malley said Clinton understands the country&#39;s international obligation as opposed to Trump who lacks experience in the global stage.&quot;He wants the US to pull out of Nato, supports Russia&#39;s Vladimir Putin ideologies, and says he will order military to kill family members in enemy combat. He wants to build a wall between the US and Mexico and segregate Muslims,&quot; said Governor O&#39;Malley.&nbsp;STRONGEST POINTSCampaign chairman for the Trump team in Virginia State maintained that the Republican presidential candidate has the strongest points to make &#39;America great again&#39; and includes concentrating more on domestic issues.&quot;We are not going to focus on risk policies. We will do what is best for Americans, which includes building of the wall to reduce the influx of immigrants into the US. We will only engage in wars that are in favour of America- ISIS in Syria,&quot; said John Fredricks.He continued, &quot;The shipping of American companies overseas for cheap labour, only for the end products to be brought back to American market will be stopped. He will sort immigration issues and taxation.&quot;For Fredricks, Trump is going to influence regime change.
