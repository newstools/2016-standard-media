Residents have demanded the completion of stalled national government projects worth over Sh500 million. And top on their wish list is a Sh300 million college that stalled under unclear circumstances two years ago. The construction of North Rift Technical Institute, which began in 2014, ground to a halt and the contractor has since left the site, leaving the education project in suspense. Led by Ribko MCA Daniel Tuwit, residents of Chemolingot said there were other white elephant projects in the area, all funded by taxpayers. &ldquo;This is not the first Government project to stall in the area; the construction of a simple police station has been going on for almost 10 years. Government projects should be completed as quickly as possible to benefit residents. What is going on is unacceptable,&rdquo; said Mr Tuwit. The residents said some of the stalled projects may have been meant to hoodwink them into supporting the government of the day. CAMPAIGN CHIPS They accused the Government of deliberately under-funding the projects to use them again as campaign chips for the next General Election. &ldquo;The Government should not turn development projects into political bait. Releasing development funds a few months to the elections leaves a lot to be desired,&rdquo; said Reuben Chebet. A spot check by The Standard established that some of the walls of the incomplete college had started crumbling; the gate is slowly being covered by a growing thorny bush. However, Tiaty Deputy County Commissioner Daniel Kurui denied the allegations, saying the project was 70 per cent complete. He said the sub-county was hosting three other national government projects and called for understanding. &ldquo;Yes, it is true that the project stalled but that has since been sorted out and it is now back on track. By early next year, we are sure it will be complete,&rdquo; said Mr Kirui. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
