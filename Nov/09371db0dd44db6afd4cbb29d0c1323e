The burial ceremony of a terror attack victim was disrupted when his grandfather barred mourners from accessing the final resting place. A standoff occurred at the homestead of Daniel Wang&#39;ombe after his daughter, Mary Nyawira, secretly collected her son&#39;s body from the Nyeri County Referral Hospital mortuary and took it to the father&#39;s compound in Honi village, Nyeri County. Villagers who had been attending another burial ceremony at the victim&#39;s uncle&#39;s nearby farm left hurriedly when they learnt his body had been brought home.&nbsp; When news trickled in that Simon Mwangi&#39;s&#39;s body was at his grandfather&#39;s compound, mourners hurriedly interred&nbsp;Amos Njogu&#39;s (the uncle) remains and left for Wang&#39;ombe&#39;s home. Mwangi&#39;s burial was allegedly scheduled for today at Nyeri ACK public cemetery since his grandfather had denied the family permission to bury him in his farm. Police, led by Nyeri Central Assistant County Commissioner John Marete, visited the home alongside village elders, ostensibly to convince the elderly man to allow the burial to take place but Mr Wang&#39;ombe stood his ground.

Emotional outburst Villagers had a hard time trying to calm her down. When they did, the meeting resumed. But despite her emotional outbursts her father did not budge, and insisted that the body be removed from his compound. He said he could only forgive Nyawira and her son if they paid him Sh1.8 million severance fee. But at 4.30pm, villagers had had enough and they stormed the compound and started digging a grave next to Mwangi&#39;s house. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
