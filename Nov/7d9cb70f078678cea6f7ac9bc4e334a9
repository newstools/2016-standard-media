Kisii: Students at Nyabururu Girls High School in Kisii County have gone on rampage after the interdiction of Principal Elmelda Onchenge. The students even blocked the Principal from leaving the school compound. The over 400 form four candidates also barred police officers from the Quick Response Team from accessing the school. It is not clear what led to the interdiction of the Principal but a few weeks ago, the new Kisii County Education Director William Surgut had indicated that they were investigating some alleged cases of corporal punishment in the school. Surgut promised to issue detailed information later on.

It is not logical to interdict a school head five days to a national examination,&rdquo; says Julius Omari, a parent at the school.
