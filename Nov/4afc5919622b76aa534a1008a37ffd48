Ronald Melly, the man accused of practising medicine without the necessary qualifications, yesterday returned home to a hero&#39;s welcome. Residents of Chemamul, Tinderet sub-county on Sunday turned out in large numbers to welcome &quot;Dr&nbsp;Melly&quot;, 28, back to the&nbsp;village following tribulations that have seen him hauled before a court. Women sang and danced to traditional songs, usually reserved for those who have displayed heroic actions, to a beaming Melly who was bedecked with flowers which hang down his neck. Melly, who was released on a Sh500,000 bond last week, is said to have taken a tour around the village with more villagers milling around him. He told the villagers that &quot;the Government had let him come back home&quot;. The locals are said to have urged their hero, who arrived in style in a high-powered delegation of top-of-the-range vehicles, to vie for the position of Member of County Assembly (MCA). The homecoming was organised in his honour by his relatives and supporters. The villagers called on the county government to give a scholarship to the &quot;intelligent doctor&quot; and encourage him to complete his education, arguing that &quot;Melly did not kill anyone&quot;.

Human rights activists in Nandi were particularly angered by the decision to give Melly a hero&#39;s welcome. Simon Nyoros, the chairman of the umbrella body for human rights bodies in the county, termed the celebrations &quot;rebel action&quot; against laws that define &quot;right and justice&quot;. Nyoros encouraged Nandi residents who may have information on any misconduct by Melly to report to the police. &quot;We as human rights watch bodies are utterly disgusted that a suspected case of impunity and disregard for the laws is being celebrated this way. What are we trying to tell our children? That impunity is rewarded?&quot; posed Nyoros. Tinderet MCA Kipkurui Chepkwony blamed ignorance on the part of the villagers for the celebrations. He said most residents were unaware of the seriousness of Melly&#39;s actions. &quot;I believe ignorance is to blame for this kind of celebratory reaction. They may not be aware of the gravity of the issue that endangered the lives of many,&quot; said Chemamul.
