They did not immediately emerge from the capsule as CCTV said they were undergoing medical examination, but mission commander Zhang Youxia, who is also a senior military official, said in a televised speech that they were in &quot;good condition&quot;.&quot;The Tiangong 2 and Shenzhou 11 flight duties were a complete success,&quot; Zhang said.Tiangong 2 will remain in its orbit and next docks with Tianzhou 1, China&#39;s first cargo spacecraft, which is set to be launched in April next year, according to state media.&nbsp;In a manned space mission in 2013, three Chinese astronauts spent 15 days in orbit and docked with a space laboratory, the Tiangong 1.Advancing China&#39;s space program is a priority for Beijing, with President Xi Jinping calling for the country to establish itself as a space power.The U.S. Defense Department has highlighted China&#39;s increasing space capabilities, saying it was pursuing activities aimed at preventing other nations using space-based assets in a crisis.China has been working to develop its space program for military, commercial and scientific purposes, but is still playing catch-up to established space powers the United States and Russia.
