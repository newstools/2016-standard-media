Deputy President William Ruto has told off Governor Peter Munya for zoning off Meru region, two days after the latter termed the former a political tourist. &quot;If there is anybody worried about my being here, he should know I will continue to come. I come here because I love you as hardworking people,&quot; said Mr Ruto during a fundraiser at the Methodist Church in Kenya&#39;s Kaaga Synod yesterday. Ruto, who was in the company of Senator Kiraitu Murungi, nine MPs and MCAs, said the Jubilee Government had initiated many development projects in the region. Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi told Munya off for calling Ruto a political tourist. &quot;Ruto is our close friend and local residents send us to invite him because they want him to help them build schools, churches and other projects. I have heard Munya call him a political tourist and we want him to engage in good politics, not insults,&quot; Mr Linturi said. Ruto appealed to local residents to continue supporting the Jubilee Government.
