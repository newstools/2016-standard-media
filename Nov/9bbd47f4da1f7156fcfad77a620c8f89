A lawyer who allegedly shielded a school principal accused of murder from being re-arrested in Murang&#39;a has been released from custody without charges being preferred against him. Nairobi-based lawyer Bernard Kanyiri was released on police bond following a directive by Murang&#39;a State counsel Solomon Njeru. Kanyiri was yesterday arraigned before Senior Resident Magistrate Jesse Masiga before he was whisked to Murang&#39;a Police Station where he was freed on police bond.
