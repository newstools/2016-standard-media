I blame the club management for allowing them in. I am appealing to the relevant authorities to revoke the club&#39;s permit,&quot; said Regarn Ochieng&#39;, resident.Parents thronged the court to witness their sons and daughters being tried.&quot;My daughter who is in Form Three left home on Thursday evening but I have been informed she was arrested.
