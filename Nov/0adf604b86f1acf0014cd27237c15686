Shareholders of distressed Imperial Bank are now accusing Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and the receiver manager of misinterpreting the recent court ruling.In a press statement published in the dailies yesterday, six main shareholders of the bank that has been in receivership for over a year say CBK and Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC) should continue engaging them fully in the recovery process.&ldquo;The press releases distort the nature of ruling, suggesting that the shareholders&rsquo; application was unsuccessful and that CBK and KDIC are now free to continue their own course of action without restraint,&rdquo; read the statement in part. According to the shareholders, the position by the two bodies that the court ruling gave them a go ahead to pursue their agreement with NIC Bank to assume certain assets and liabilities of Imperial Bank is incorrect.They say that the recent court ruling did not drop the June 29 orders that barred CBK and KDIC from disposing assets of the under-receivership lender.The six shareholders, Imaran Limited, Kenblest Limited, Abdumal Investments, Reynolds Limited, EA Industries and Momentum Holdings, have termed the move by CBK and KDIC as detrimental.They will now be seeking information from the two bodies about the next steps of the receivership including the arrangement with KCB, NIC Bank and Diamond Trust Bank.Disclosure&ldquo;The inquiry will extend to obtaining information about any other parties who expressed interest in Imperial Bank and for disclosure of much greater detail of financial status of the bank,&rdquo; read their statement.The recovery of the bank that was put under statutory management on October 13, 2015 with shareholders differing with KDIC and CBK on some decisions, has been slow.On September 30, 2016, KDIC and CBK filed a suit for the recovery of Sh44.9 billion against the directors and shareholders of the bank for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. Depositors also applied to be enjoined.The latest development may hurt the pace of recovery with KDIC and CBK having stated on Tuesday that it was hoping to review NIC contract as it carries on due diligence.
