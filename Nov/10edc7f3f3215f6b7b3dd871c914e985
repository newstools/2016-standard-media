Bad working relations between top bosses at the Ministry of Health came to light before MPs yesterday.Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri told the National Assembly&#39;s Health Committee he was kept in the dark on the audit at the ministry, whose leaked findings have now sparked public outrage.Asked to describe his working relationship with Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu, the PS said given he wasn&#39;t informed about important issues in the ministry, it summed up their relations. Dr Muraguri shocked the MPs investigating the alleged loss of billions of shillings at the ministry when he divulged that an audit was done without his knowledge.The PS, who maintained that no money was lost in the ministry&#39;s coffers, said the audit was commissioned behind his back with the interim report of the probe getting to the media before he was made aware of the exercise.&quot;Normal Government internal audit process was not followed, that is why we are where we are. I got the letter from the internal auditor on October 24, 2016, almost two months after it was written by the CS on August 28, 2016,&quot; he told the Rachel Nyamai-led team.&quot;In normal circumstances, the internal auditor writes to the PS, who writes to the CS. Every rule was flouted in the matter. People who were being audited were not given a chance to respond. Now the whole country is discussing an half-baked interim report,&quot; added Muraguri.Meanwhile, Dr Mailu was questioned by anti-graft detectives for five hours over graft claims in his office.Dr Mailu arrived at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission&#39;s (EACC) Integrity Centre offices shortly after 9am alone and left at 2pm.&quot;I will continue doing my work. I hope all agencies will be able to get to the bottom of the issue,&quot; he told journalists when he emerged.He said he had answered all the questions that were put to him and recorded his statement. &quot;I wait for the EACC investigations on this issue,&quot; he added.His grilling came a day after his Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri was also questioned over questionable procurement processes that may have cost the taxpayer Sh3.1 billion.The ministry says the amount in question was put to good use. EACC is investigating claims that there was double payment for goods and some money cannot be accounted for.Internal auditor Bernard Muchere and the ministry&#39;s head of accounting, Joyce Mutugi, were questioned on Tuesday.
