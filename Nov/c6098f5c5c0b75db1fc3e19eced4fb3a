&nbsp; Tanzania&rsquo;s President John Pombe Magufuli&rsquo;s advice on tribalism should not be lost in the din of the visit. He spoke as a true friend and a brother to Kenya. Everything in Kenya is superb, but he noted that the country suffers from tribalism. It is the worst form of corruption and it is so deeply entrenched in the Kenyan society. Magufuli is not the first leader to say this. Both US President Barack Obama and the Pope mentioned it. The Pope was more direct. &ldquo;Tribalism equals destruction,&rdquo; he said. With only 43 tribes, after the inclusion of the Makonde, President Magufuli said unity can be attained. In Tanzania, he said, they have attained it and yet they have over 100 tribes. Tribalism can destroy the peace and unity we cherish as envisioned in our national anthem. The onus falls on the leaders and the citizens. Kenyans should resist any calls by leaders to engage in activities that may divide them along tribal lines.
