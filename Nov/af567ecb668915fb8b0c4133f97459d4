Coalition for Reforms and Democracy co-principal Raila Odinga has called on the government to move with speed and resolve the Isiolo-Meru boundary row.Raila called for amicable solution to the dispute that has dragged on since 2014 and has left scores injured and others killed.&quot;There is no need for communities to fight and yet the boundary is known. The Jubilee administration should step in and resolve the matter,&quot; Raila said. The former prime minister, who was accompanied by a host of MPs and aspirants eyeing various seats on the party&rsquo;s ticket in the 2017 polls, was speaking at Isiolo Stadium yesterday afternoon after addressing another meeting in Merti in the morning.The ODM leader was accompanied by among others Mombasa and Kilifi women representatives Mashi Mboko and Aisha Juma respectively, Adan Kabelo, Isiolo gubernatorial aspirant and former National Assembly Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim.A local ODM MCA Hassan Shano appealed to Raila to help Isiolo regain land it lost to Meru, claiming the Jubilee administration favours their rival &lsquo;due to their numerical strength&rsquo;.&quot;We have been marginalised by past administrations. The regions being claimed by Meru are all in Isiolo, but nobody can take a firm decision because they want the Meru vote because the are is densely populated,&quot; Shano claimed.However, the Interior and Lands ministries sent a team of surveyors earlier in the year to determine the boundary. Only Meru residents attended while Isiolo residents went to the High Court in Nairobi, but the case is still pending.Isiolo County Commissioner George Natembeya said it was established that the disputed areas fall in Meru but the report is yet to be made public.
