Detectives investigating the Sh51 million IFMIS scandal in Kilifi County have already identified the suspects. Assembly Speaker Jimmy Kahindi, who is leading an investigation into the matter, yesterday asked MCAs to stop discussing the matter in public as suspects will be charged soon. Kahindi said in Malindi that leaked reports about the investigation of financial expenditure by the General Oversight Committee which he chairs, are misleading and had tainted the image of the House. &quot;I have henceforth forbidden Members of the County Assembly from commenting on issues before the House and its committees until final reports are officially released,&quot; said the Speaker as he directed journalists and the public to verify facts with his office whenever certain issues arise.
