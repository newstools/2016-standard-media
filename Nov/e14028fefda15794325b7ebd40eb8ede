Young pregnant women are twice likely to suffer stroke compared to their older counterparts, a new study suggests.Dispelling fears that pregnancy in older women increases the risk of stroke, the study by Columbia University in New York, US has instead said it is younger pregnant women and mothers who should be more worried.According to the study published by Jama Neurology on October 24, pregnant women or those who have given birth between ages of 12 and 24 were at higher risk of stroke (14 in every 100,000) than those who were not expectant in the same age group (six in 100,000). Among women aged 25 to 34, the study indicated the risk went up 1.6 times. However, risk levels in both pregnant and non-pregnant women in the older age group was the same.The study further showed at least 34 in 100,000 women suffer from pregnancy-associated stroke.This was after examining data collected from women admitted to hospital for stroke between 2003 and 2012.Some 797 women out of 19,146 between the ages 12 and 55 were pregnant at their admission to hospital or had just given birth.The researchers led by Prof Joshua Willey found out that the overall risk of stroke during or after pregnancy increased with age; at least 46 per cent per 100,000 women aged from 45 to 55 and 14 per cent in those aged 12 and 24.&quot;Pregnancy does not increase stroke risk in older women but does increase risk in younger women,&quot; reads the October 24 study.Though the study did not deduce the causes of the risk factors in pregnant women, according to the University of Texas medical centre; gestational diabetes, hypertension and increased bleeding during childbirth are some of the factors.It also cited symptoms of stroke during pregnancy as seizures, faintness on any body part, and severe headache.Evans Nyambega from Stroke Association of Kenya indicated there are no clear statistics and demographics on persons suffering from stroke but noted it is a devastating condition that anyone can have.
