President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Tanzanian counterpart John Pombe Magufuli yesterday sought to calm speculation on strained relations between the two countries.During a press briefing at State House in Nairobi, yesterday the two leaders called for greater partnerships and increased economic co-operation. The two presidents were keen to debunk perceptions of a &#39;cold war&#39;, which some observers have linked to the Tanzanian leader&#39;s failure to visit the country since he assumed office in November, last year.The press briefing dwelt on how the two counties can work together to improve trade and friendly relations.&quot;Kenya and Tanzania are among the few countries in Africa that have had democratic exchange of power. I can say without fear of contradiction that we have shared principles that bind us together. The journey we are undertaking to is to strengthen the relationship between the two countries,&quot; said President Kenyatta.Joint teamHe also announced the formation of a joint team by the two countries to oversee the implementation of issues of trade and security.&quot;I want to assure you that we are brothers. I&#39;m asking Kenyans intending to do business in Tanzania to feel free to come. We want to do business with Kenyans as we look forward to expanding our economies,&quot; said the Tanzanian president, who was honoured with a 21-gun salute during his maiden visit.Although Kenya is Tanzania&#39;s largest trading partner, this fact has been overshadowed by shadow-boxing arising out of peer rivalry, jealousy and battles for economic dominance.In recent days, Kenya has lost lucrative deals to Tanzania, including a decision by Uganda and Rwanda to overlook the country&#39;s oil pipeline in favour of Tanzania&#39;s.The two countries are also battling to win over landlocked countries to use their two competing ports of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam.In recent days, Tanzania has also pulled out of the common East Africa visa plan and the European Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the East Africa Community.During their bilateral talks, the two leaders also discussed the security situation in the region.
