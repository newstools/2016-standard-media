Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchuma Murkomen has denied allegations that his client dealt with&nbsp;National Youth Service (NYS) loot. This comes after fresh details emerged showing that Singoi Murkomen and Sigei Advocates, a law firm owned by Murkomen and Ruto&#39;s legal advisor Korir Sing&#39;oei, received Sh15 million from Out of the Box Solutions said to be linked to the NYS scandal. Dismissing a statement by Anne Waiguru as false, Murkomen accused the former Devolution Cabinet secretary of attempting to cast his law firm and its clients in negative light. Murkomen said the firm represents a wide spectrum of clientele and that it had never received payment from any NYS contractor. &quot;Our client,&nbsp;Out of the Box Solutions, has never worked or been contracted by NYS. The allegations by Ms Waiguru through her agents that our law firm was paid legal fees amounting to Sh15 million is a figment of her imagination,&quot; he said. He, however, added the firm, like any other law firm, receives funds for and on behalf of its clients on instructions.
