The national government owes Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital Sh27 million meant for free maternity. The revelations were made yesterday by the county assembly Health Committee, which also said the hospital faces a serious shortage of staff and drugs. Dr Enock Ondari, the hospital&#39;s CEO, said they expect to receive the money anytime soon and urged mothers to enroll with the National Hospital Insurance Fund. Dr Ondari also noted that the hospital has a nine-bed ICU but lacks nurses.
