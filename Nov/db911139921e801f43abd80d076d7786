&nbsp; A Kenyan woman abducted by a Somali militia two years ago has been rescued by special forces from an autonomous region of war-torn Somalia. Director of Mombasa-based East African Seafarers Assistance Programme Andrew Mwangura said Loise Weru, from Bahati in Nakuru County, was rescued by Galmudug Special Forces last Saturday. Ms Weru had been taken hostage alongside James Kuria, who was rescued earlier this year. The two were taken hostage by suspected Al Shabaab militia as they sold herbal medicine in Somalia. Mr Mwangura said no ransom was paid for Ms Weru, maintaining she was rescued in a military rescue operation. &quot;She is now in the safe hands of the local authorities in Galmudug waiting to be repatriated back home,&quot; said Mr Mwangura in a statement.
