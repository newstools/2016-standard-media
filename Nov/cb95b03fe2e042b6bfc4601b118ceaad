A competent driver must have a rudimentary knowledge of mechanics.I recall an incident on the torturous Lurambi-Nambacha road in Kakamega where an oncoming, speeding vehicle made me pull off the road. Drawing level, the car stopped.The driver came out and confided in me his vehicle had suddenly become &lsquo;automatic&rsquo; and he did not know what to do. A look under the hood showed the accelerator cable had derailed and got stuck. Simply pulling it back into its groove worked.Again, one late evening on a lonely stretch of the Kaimosi-Chavakali road, a lady driver stopped me asking for a ride to go and get a mechanic.On enquiring what the problem was, she said the engine had suddenly switched off and couldn&rsquo;t restart.A cursory inspection showed the ignition coil wire had come off the clip. I clipped it back on, closed the hood and told her the car was okay; that she did not need a mechanic.These true experiences sum up our political dilemma.Here we are in a beat-up vehicle christened Kenya, whose accelerator is stuck on corruption hurtling towards the precipice and the driver is bemused.Here we are, stranded by the roadside unable to reach destinations designated &lsquo;Vision 2030&rsquo; and &lsquo;developed nation&rsquo; because a non-fault that requires only the effort it takes to lift a hand to fix has our driver transfixed, wondering what to do.Writing in this column last year, I opined that corruption should be legalised.Government apologists instantly got on my case but, like a pregnancy, the evidence of massive corruption in Government is there for everybody to see. It won&rsquo;t go away until someone aborts it, for surely, it will bring forth healthy offspring.While First Lady Margaret Kenyatta ran marathons to help set up mobile clinics for expectant mothers, a few officials at the Health ministry who, incidentally, are said to be related to the first family, were busy pilfering public funds earmarked for the same purpose.Anyone doubting that corruption has been perfected by those serving the Jubilee administration at the highest levels hasn&rsquo;t lived in Kenya long enough. Increased high-profile corruption scandals beg the questions; does the top leadership have the moral authority to steer the ship of state?Given the perceived wickedness of some, are they cast in the mould of leaders who, as the bible says, come from God?Are they at peace with themselves leaving behind a legacy of divisiveness, bitterness, plunder and ineptitude? Is Chapter Six of the Constitution on integrity an unnecessary appendage that should be expunged?Regrettably, it&rsquo;s not just on corruption that Kenya is stranded.Let&rsquo;s consider the repeated terrorist attacks in Mandera. Between November 2014 and October 25, 2016, at least 84 people have been killed by the Al Shabaab.Internal strife that led to a six-month state of emergency in Ethiopia recently saw the country withdraw its soldiers from Somalia in a bid to boost its security.International media reports indicate after Ethiopia&rsquo;s withdrawal, Al Shabaab have retaken the towns of Haligan, El-Ali, Mahas and hoisted their black flags.Clearly, gains made by the 22,000-strong African Union army and the 35,000-man Somalia army since 2011 are getting lost.Al Shabaab is reasserting itself. Given the rising number of attacks in Mogadishu, they are staging a come-back for which Kenya must prepare.It is not enough that after the October 25, 2016 Mandera attack, the Government declared a two-month curfew. That&rsquo;s inadequate, even futile in dealing with the militants.Fighting an unseen enemy not intimidated by a combined force of almost 60,000 soldiers calls for tougher measures.Among other things from a civilian&#39;s perspective, there is need for tougher controls and strict monitoring of hotel guests and people in residential areas.Mandera does not have too many of these to make it a daunting task. Deploying to Mandera the hundreds of idle, lazy, obese law enforcers who habitually collect bribes from motorists could bring about change.A concentration of security personnel armed with state-of-the-art equipment could be a game changer. It would help to close the border indefinitely and designate no-assembly, no-movement zones.Because civilian targets embolden the militants, a permanent military base with an air wing can slow down the miscreants.The gloves must come off. Employ the scorched earth policy, bomb all known Al Shabaab hideouts and give them something to worry about.Last, even though it could easily turn out to be another source of sleaze, the Kenya&ndash;Somalia wall must be speeded up.
