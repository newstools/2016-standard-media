When Lydia Bosibori completed her Diploma in Business Management, she looked forward to landing a white collar jobs.Ten years later, this dream was yet to materialise and she decided to join the juakali sector setting up a shoe shiner business in Kisii town.&quot;I started becoming frustrated as financial constraints put a strain on my marriage. I decided to look around and see what work I could do that was not very competitive. It was then I observed that there was no female shoe-shiner in Kisii town,&quot; the mother of five says. With her mind made up and with only Sh200 in her pocket, Lydia purchased a brush and shoe polich&nbsp;then officially set up the open air business.&quot;I decided to take this plunge after separation from my husband. I knew life has to go on and I needed to take care of my children and myself,&quot; she says.Today, Lydia is able to cater for her needs. During the rainy season, when her business is at peak, she makes a daily profit of Sh500 and Sh400 during the other days.&quot;This work has its ups and downs and many times I find people who will undermine me for being a woman doing what is considered a man&#39;s job. I however, keep going not allowing their jabs to get to me,&quot; she says.Her only appeal is for the county government to set up stalls where those like her, operating open air businesses, are not affected by the elements.
