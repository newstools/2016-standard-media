A local civil society organisation is pushing for the&nbsp;resignation&nbsp;of&nbsp;top&nbsp;Ministry of Health officials named in the Sh3.1 billion scandal.National Civil Society Congress officials said they were out to ensure that those looting public resources were kicked out of office and punished.&quot;Crooks in the ministry are stealing from babies and pregnant women, HIV and Aids patients, accident victims and cancer patients,&quot; said the organisation&#39;s president, Morris Odhiambo.Speaking during a&nbsp;demonstration outside Afya House in Nairobi yesterday, Mr Odhiambo said, &quot;Corruption is undermining Kenya&#39;s sovereignty and standing in the global community. It is also contributing to death and despair among citizens.&quot;Odhiambo is concerned about the purchase of 100 container clinics at a cost of Sh10 million, saying it would have been better to build a clinic.The protesters were able to submit a petition to a ministry official as two police vehicles and over 50 General Service Unit officers armed with tear gas and guns camped outside Afya House in anticipation of rowdiness.
