Kanu Secretary General Nick Salat wants the sourcing of the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) investigated.IFMIS is a computer system that processes procurement and payment of goods bought by the Government. The system led to the loss of billions of shillings at the National Youth Service.Mr Salat has alleged people with prior knowledge of the system&#39;s weakness would have had an upper hand in its acquisition.&quot;It is time to go back and look at it again. The fraud that has transpired at NYS is shocking and there is need to re-look at how it was acquired in the past place,&quot; said Salat.Mr Salat said the country should know if the system was competitively sourced.He said it was ironical that a system that was meant to reduce wastage in Government was behind the loss of billions of shillings.&quot;The system seems to have assisted criminals to loot public money at will, information that there was double payments at NYS tells it all,&#39;&#39; he said.In November last year, former Devolution and Planning Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru resigned following months of sustained pressure over corruption allegations in her ministry.On Wednesday, appearing before parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) at Parliament Buildings, former Principal Secretary Peter Mangiti described IFMIS as opaque.Former senior deputy director general of NYS Aden Harakhe also narrated to PAC how tech-savvy officers based at the Treasury&#39;s Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), would hack into the system and make fictitious claims, helping companies allied to them swindle millions of shillings from the service.
