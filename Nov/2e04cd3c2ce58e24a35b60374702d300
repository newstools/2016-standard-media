Former Devolution Principal Secretary Peter&nbsp;Mangiti&nbsp;and&nbsp;15&nbsp;others&nbsp;were arrested yesterday&nbsp;over&nbsp;the&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;scandal after honouring summonses and presenting themselves to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). An arrest warrant was issued for eight&nbsp;other&nbsp;suspects who had not heeded the summonses, as police swung into action to ensure they are also&nbsp;charged&nbsp;in court. The suspects, all senior officials at the Ministry of Devolution and Planning, were immediately herded into a bus at Nairobi&rsquo;s Integrity Centre and driven to the Milimani Law Courts where they were&nbsp;charged&nbsp;with various offences. It would appear none of the suspects, who included former director of finance Samuel Wechenje, did not know they would be arrested, as individuals who have appeared before the EACC for questioning in the past, have been allowed to leave after sessions with detectives. However, yesterday,&nbsp;Mangiti, Wechenje, Henry Nyongesa, Ruth Njeri, Hezbon Makobongo, Michael Ojiambo, James Kirigwi, Samuel Odhiambo, Freshiah Kamau, Moses Osoro and Florence Bett were all arrested and taken to court where they denied unlawfully awarding a Sh47 million contract without following procurement rules. (see separate story) The officials arrived at Integrity Centre between 7am and 8am and were led inside the building by a contingent of police officers who were expecting them at the EACC premises.

EACC spokesperson Yasin Amaro said the 16 suspects had their fingerprints taken and entered into the national data base before they were herded into a bus at about 9.30am and taken to court. According to the&nbsp;charge&nbsp;sheet, 14 of the 24 suspects will answer to&nbsp;charges&nbsp;of conspiracy to commit an economic crime, contrary to the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act. This is the second&nbsp;charge&nbsp;Mangiti&nbsp;is facing in relation to the National Youth Service scandal. On November 18, he was first&nbsp;charged&nbsp;with conspiracy to steal Sh695 million. Police yesterday launched a search for former&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;Deputy Director Adan Harakhe, former tender committee chairman Hassan Noor and six&nbsp;others&nbsp;who did not honour the summonses. Besides Harakhe and Noor, police are looking for Ruth Kiiru, Salim Molla, Kennedy Nyamao, Florence Bett, Betty Muriithi and Jenniffer Kinoti. Ms Muriithi and Ms Kinoti were to be&nbsp;chargedwith fraudulent acquisition of public property. The magistrate ordered that they be presented in court on December 9. Investigators say they could not trace them in their homes yesterday, adding that their phones had been switched off. &ldquo;In such a case we just have to issue arrest warrants and employ&nbsp;other&nbsp;tactics to trace them and have them in court,&rdquo; said Amaro. EACC Chief Executive Officer Halakhe Waqo said the commission was looking into 14 projects whose tenders are suspected to have been awarded unlawfully. Some individuals will face specific&nbsp;charges, he noted. &ldquo;They face the&nbsp;charge&nbsp;of forging contracts in a particular matter. There are about 20 or 25 people to face the&nbsp;charges, among them PS&nbsp;Mangiti&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;senior officials in the ministry. By the end of the day, we will make sure they are all arraigned in court,&rdquo; said Waqo. The EACC has come under intense pressure in recent weeks to demonstrate that investigators into corruption allegations are making headway, especially after former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru and businesswoman Josephine Kabura appeared before the National Assembly&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee and listed some of those who may have had dealings with the&nbsp;NYS&nbsp;in relation to the scandal.
