Shareholders of troubled retailer Uchumi will have to wait until next year to know the financial status of the listed firm.This is after the supermarket chain announced it will release its financial results on New Year&rsquo;s eve.The retailer attributed the decision to a winding up suit facing it, which it said had impacted operations this year, but did not reveal to what extent. &ldquo;The financial statements for the year ending June 30 shall be published on or before December 31 due to the turbulent business environment faced by the company, including defending a winding up petition,&rdquo; said Chief Executive Julius Kipng&rsquo;etich in a notice to investors.This is the second year running that Uchumi has had to delay reporting its financial results.The retail chain in results released on November 28 last year posted a Sh3.2 billion loss after being given a 30-day extension to issue its financial results by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA).The due date for submission of financial results is usually October 31, but the retailer was given an extension to publish its results by November 30.Disgruntled suppliersThursday, CMA said it regarded each application separately and ruled based on merits of the said application.&ldquo;In considering any request for an extension for the publication of financial information, the authority is guided by the factors evidenced in the supporting information that may be requested to support such an application. In all events, any extension must be approved by the authority,&rdquo; CMA told The Standard.The retailer&rsquo;s efforts to get back on track after a tumultuous last couple of months was halted by disgruntled suppliers who sought to close it down and recover their dues.The retailer owes suppliers Sh3.6 billion with another Sh2.5 billion owed to banks against an asset base of Sh6.1 billion, a negative asset position.The stand-off has seen several suppliers withdraw their products from the retailer&rsquo;s shelves while the suit has prevented it from transacting with new parties given it could be liquidated.In a bid to stay afloat, Uchumi signed an agreement with friendly suppliers, which created an escrow account that allowed the retailer to only take up 20 per cent of sales to meet its overhead costs with the rest of the money going to settle immediate supplier debt.
