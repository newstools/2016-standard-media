Former Mwea MP Allan Njeru is dead. The one-term MP was elected on a DP ticket during the 1992 General Election. Bishop Njeru died on Monday night aged 74 at a private hospital in Thika town, according to her elder sister, Nancy Wangu. Ms Wangu said her brother had undergone surgery at the facility a month ago and appeared to recover but his condition deteriorated over the weekend, leading to the death. &quot;My brother had a swelling of the pancreas, which compelled medics to operate on him,&quot; she said. Speaking at the former legislator&#39;s Thiba village home yesterday, Wangu said burial arrangements were in top gear. Njeru rose to prominence when he defected to Kanu, a day before the first multi-party parliament was dissolved in 1997. Njeru shocked Kenyans when he said he would rather compromise his Opposition ideals if that would compel the Government to issue title deeds to the Mwea rice farmers.
