Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s lead over Donald Trump in the popular count of the US presidential election has increased to two million votes. Republican President-elect Mr Trump won the election by winning a majority of the electoral college votes, and he will be inaugurated in January. But with votes still being counted, two weeks on, the Cook Political Report has his tally at 62.2m and hers at 64.2m. It is the fifth time the winner of the popular vote has lost the election. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore&rsquo;s final lead over George W Bush, who won the election after a prolonged legal challenge, was nearly 544,000. The Supreme Court ultimately decided that election by awarding Mr Bush a win in the contested state of Florida.

A group of academics, lawyers and data experts is also trying to persuade the Clinton team to join their effort to investigate the results in three states to check there was no foreign computer hacking that manipulated the outcome. They are curious why Ms Clinton performed worse in counties that relied on electronic voting machines compared to paper ballots and optical scanners. But her campaign has not indicated any interest in joining a fight for a recount.
