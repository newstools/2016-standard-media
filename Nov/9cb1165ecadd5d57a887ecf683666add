The US Election Day arrived at last, and Americans headed to the polls to have their say in the choice of the next President. Some paused to talk about their decisions and the tensions of the moment. Thomas Tillotson and Russ Van Deursen differed when they voted for President early yesterday in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, one of the first polling sites to open in the nation. But they were in solid agreement on one thing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very exciting to be the first in the nation,&rdquo; said Mr Deursen adding, &ldquo;Your vote is right out there in the small little hamlet that we have of seven or eight voters and it feels like you&rsquo;re a real part of democracy.&rdquo; He voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton because &ldquo;our country needs to move forward and I didn&rsquo;t believe that a presidency with (Republican) Donald Trump would move forward in a positive way.&rdquo; Polls in the town opened just after midnight closed as soon as everyone had voted. TOUGH DECISION READ MORE Poll shows Hillary Clinton on the verge of history At long last, Americans decide between Clinton and Trump Trump gains popularity in some battleground States &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honour and privilege to be the first and this is my 11th time doing it and it never gets boring,&rdquo; said Mr Tillotson, a 71-year-old business consultant who voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson. He said both major parties have &ldquo;gone in directions that really don&rsquo;t fit who I am and what I believe&rdquo;. When Art Meadowcroft exited city hall in Plymouth, Minnesota on Monday after casting an early ballot, he reached into his pocket for a camouflage cap bearing Donald Trump&rsquo;s slogan, &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo;, and placed it on his head. &ldquo;It was a tough decision because he certainly had his very rough sides,&rdquo; Mr Meadowcroft, 62, said of Trump, his choice for President. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think there is a question mark when it comes down to what is in his heart and what he wants for the country,&rdquo; he added. Mr Meadowcroft, a former college administrator, coach and real estate agent who is now retired, went to vote with his sister, bringing sandwiches to pass the time in a long line.
