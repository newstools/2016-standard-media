Members of County Assembly in Homa Bay have denied claims that they were fighting over Sh4 million. There were reports on social media that the MCAs fought over the money on Friday evening at a hotel. But yesterday, the assembly Minority Leader Isaac Nyandege addressed a press conference in Homa Bay town and dismissed the allegations as false and malicious. Nyandege said they had met to discuss why there was inequitable distribution of development projects in the county. &ldquo;We met as 40 elected MCAs to discuss how development projects can be undertaken in our county well. Take solar lamps for instance, some wards have six, others have ten and the disparity continues. That is why we didn&rsquo;t invite any nominated MCA,&rdquo; said Nyandege. He said there was only a disagreement between Homa Bay Central MCA Julius Nyambok and his Wang&rsquo;chieng&rsquo; counterpart Peter Kaula over change of venue from the hotel. Nyandege said those perpetrating the rumours had ill motives. He said their meeting did not yield fruits after the two MCAs differed. Our efforts to talk to Kaula proved futile.
