CORD leader&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;Odinga has asked his supporters to get ready to send the Jubilee leadership home next year, even as Deputy President William&nbsp;Ruto&nbsp;campaigned&nbsp;for President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election. As&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;addressed Opposition supporters at Orengo Primary School in Bondo constituency yesterday where he said rampant corruption had taken the country down a dangerous path, the DP highlighted some of the key achievements of the Jubilee government, saying claims of corruption were unfounded.

He said&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;had nothing to show for his 20 years as a Cabinet minister, adding that former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, former Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi had collectively served in government for 30 years, but had no tangible development record to their names. But&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;described the government as a failure and said the country was at a crossroads owing to runaway corruption and mismanagement of public resources. &ldquo;This government has totally failed Kenyans and we must make choices that will determine a better future for all of us,&rdquo; he said. Raila&nbsp;said Kenyans must remain united and be prepared to sweep to power in the next elections because the Jubilee administration will not be ready to cede power easily.
