Deputy President William Ruto has moved to allay fears that the Government is planning to privatise the Port of Mombasa. He said reports suggesting that there was such a plan were&nbsp;baseless. Mr Ruto said this during a meeting with port employees at Mbaraki Sports Club where the Dock Workers Union backed President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election bid, yesterday. The DP said the Government had spent billions of shillings in modernising and expanding the port. &quot;We want to commercialise the port and make it efficient. We will be insane to think of selling the port after spending billions to expand and modernise it,&quot; he added. Ruto said he will&nbsp;convene a meeting with the National Treasury, the Attorney General and Dock Workers Union (DWU) to deliberate on issues affecting workers at the port, next week.

And Mombasa gubernatorial aspirant Suleiman Shahbal&nbsp;announced that a&nbsp;special fund had been formed at&nbsp;Gulf Bank to ensure&nbsp;KPA workers&nbsp;access interest free loans. TRANSPORT SECTOR DWU Chairman Mohamed Sheria and Secretary General Simon Sang&#39; said five unions representing workers in the transport sector will back Jubilee in the August 8 General Election. &quot;In 2013, propaganda that Jubilee leaders would grab our (Coast&#39;s) resources if elected created fears but that has not come to pass. As a union we have decided to support Jubilee in the next elections,&quot; Mr Sheria said. Mr Sang&#39; defended the unions&#39; move to collectively endorse a political party, saying in South Africa the deputy president is the general secretary of the unions. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
