The county government has established several small-scale irrigation schemes to boost food security across the impoverished islands. Governor Issa Timamy said in an interview with The Standard yesterday that his administration has spent Sh14 million since 2015 on the small-scale irrigation schemes, designed as a &lsquo;ladder out of poverty&rsquo; for rural communities and small-holder farmers. The devolved unit&rsquo;s ambitious rural irrigation scheme seeks to link villages through nearest possible sources of water. SUPPORT AGRICULTURE Schemes that are transforming livelihoods are at Mkunumbi, Basuba, Witu, Moa, Chalaluma and Maleli areas. The county boss says in order to make agricultural production more sustainable in the region, the county government is empowering farmers who venture into irrigation.

Mr Timamy said they have also started distributing high quality seeds and fertilisers to farmers to improve yields. The county government supports irrigation projects covering more than 57 acres using water sources from Lake Moa and Lake Amu. The move is aimed at unlocking the existing potential in the county to improve food security, income of farmers and general livelihoods of the residents. During a recent visit in Moa by The Standard, a mainly fishing village within the expansive Tana Delta region, scores of peasant women groups have taken the lead and are using irrigation to farm. For these women, fishing has become unreliable and the catch volumes have dwindled over the years forcing them to rethink how they can contribute to their families. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
