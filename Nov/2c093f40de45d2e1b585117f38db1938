Machakos Governor Dr Alfred Mutua has threatened to sue Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka for calling him a &quot;kidnapper and a killer&quot;. Speaking yesterday during his one-week campaign trail to popularise his Maendeleo Chap Chap party in Kitui County, Dr Mutua said the remarks had tainted his reputation. &quot;I will definitely sue him for calling me a killer. I cannot tolerate a leader&nbsp;of his stature casting aspersions on my behaviour and calling me a kidnapper and a killer. These are unfortunate utterances,&quot; he said. Last week, the former Vice President claimed Mutua was responsible for the disappearance of Machakos Deputy Governor Benard Kiala&#39;s daughter, Kathleen Nduku.
