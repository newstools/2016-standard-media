Huge cracks have developed on a bridge along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, sparking fears that it could collapse soon. Motorists have termed the River Karati bridge along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway near Delamere Shopping centre in Naivasha a time-bomb as the cracks continue to widen. The bridge is used by motorists, including heavy trucks heading to neighbouring countries. Engineers from Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) recently repaired the affected section but this didn&rsquo;t help matters. According to Joseph Gitau, a motorist who uses the road daily, trouble started a couple of weeks ago when a pothole developed on the bridge. TYRE BURSTS &ldquo;The situation has got worse with cracks spreading and covering nearly the whole section of the bridge and unsuspecting motorists are even getting tyre bursts,&rdquo; he said. Jackson Njoroge, a matatu driver, warned fellow motorists to be careful while crossing the bridge. &ldquo;Last week a speeding motorist hit the pothole on the bridge and ended up with two tyre bursts. It&rsquo;s by good luck that his car didn&rsquo;t roll,&rdquo; he said. A senior officer with KeNHA who requested anonymity admitted there is a problem with the section of the road. &ldquo;The issue has been raised with our office and we have embarked on the process of repairing the affected section soonest possible,&rdquo; said the officer. Meanwhile, motorists using Moi South Lake Road in Naivasha have complained over its poor state. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
