Just months after declaring support for William Kabogo&#39;s re-election bid, Senator Mike Sonko has thrown his weight behind the governor&#39;s rival. On Sunday, Sonko said he will instead support Bishop David Kariuki Ngari, commonly known as Gakuyo, who is seeking to unseat Kabogo. &quot;The bishop is my friend and I will work with him all the way to the party primaries and see how things turn out,&quot; Sonko said of Gakuyo, who recently threw his hat in the ring for the governor&#39;s position in next year&#39;s elections. Sonko, who spoke in Thika Town where he represented President Uhuru Kenyatta during the launch of Gakuyo Foundation, told the cleric to remain steadfast in his quest. &quot;Do not fear the big names in the race. When I ran for Makadara MP in 2010, I battled political giants and won. Just go to the people and explain to them your agenda and vision. I can assure you, you will be the governor if you relate with people well,&quot; Sonko said. He added: &quot;Do not fear your competitors. After all, it is the people who have the votes and they will decide who their next governor will be.&quot; READ MORE Trader's entry into Kiambu governor race a game changer Put Uhuru&rsquo;s re-election bid first, aspirants urged Kabogo and Waititu prepare for bruising battle ahead of 2017 Sonko and Kabogo had formed a political front ahead of next year&#39;s elections.
