This year&#39;s US presidential elections is projected to be the most expensive with an estimated figure of US 6.6 billion dollars (Sh 668.3 billion -using the current Sh 101.25 exchange rate) more than the US 6.3 billion dollars spent in 2012.Even with this amount in mind, Republican nominee Donald Trump has personally contributed US 56 million dollars to his own campaigns while his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton has received large donations both individuals and groups.The US federal Election Commission, which is an equivalent of Kenya&#39;s the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commissions (IEBC) monitors the donations each person gets, setting the limits of what a presidential candidate can receive and spend from individual donations at US 2,700 dollars (Sh 270,000) for the primaries and US 2,700 dollars (Sh270,000) after party nominations.At the State level, the candidates&#39; individual donations stand at US 100 dollars (Sh 10,000).However at both levels, there is no limit to how much one can receive as contribution from outside groups or to their campaign committees.Despite Clinton and Trump raising over Sh120billion individually for campaigns, Trump has personally funded his over 25 percent yet the support base is still lukewarm.This is not any difference from IEBC&#39;s recent cap on campaign financing ahead of the 2017 general election in Kenya.However, compared to US and Kenya, the presidential candidates will be limited to spending US 51.8 million dolars (Sh 5.25 billion), while those contesting for the governor/senator/ women representative seats will be allowed to spend up to US 4.3 million dollars (Sh433 million).Also the political parties will be allowed to receive up to US 148.2 million dollars (Sh15.03 billion) in contributions with a single source limited to US 29.5 million dollars (Sh 3 billion).The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has said in a Kenya Gazette notice Thursday that for an aspiring MP, he or she will be required to spend up to Ksh33.4 million ($330,000) while a contestant for an member of the county assembly (MCA&#39;s) seat is allowed up to Ksh10.3 million ($101,000).Governor, Senators and Women representatives for Counties like Nairobi will be allowed to spend over 400 million while aspirants for similar seats in Lamu will only spend over 13 million.It&#39;s not a coincidence with Kenya although Americans laud the regulations, saying it good to promote accountability.&quot;When we contribute for the candidate, it makes them more accountable to us,&quot; said Sarah Cruz, a voter. She continued, &quot;I have already donated for the candidates.&quot;In the US, Executive Director, Centre for Responsive Politics Sheila Krumholz, in monitoring the campaign financing argues that the candidates are getting huge funds though Political Action Committees (PACs) and outside sources who are not bound by law to disclose the source.&quot;The candidates have devise means to defeat the law, and even infants are donating. The Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service are unable to control. Clinton&#39;s campaign has received more funds from committees and outsiders than Trump,&quot; said Krumholz.She argues that this has been the basis for Trump claiming there are plans to rig the elections yet he has also failed to disclose his tax returns.Mike Mullin and Heather Cordasco both contesting for the House of Representative in Virgina State, are both in agreement that getting huge donations from individuals ties the candidates to them.&quot;Those who offer donations want some of their issues addressed. Getting large amounts from individual means you will be indebted to them,&quot; stated Mullin.Christopher Newport University scholars Quentin Kidd and Rachael Bitecofer also stated that the Federal Election Commission is the one mandated by law to regulate the funds and candidates are summoned to file returns for accountability purposes. This commission not only monitor campaign financing but also deal with electoral malpractice.
