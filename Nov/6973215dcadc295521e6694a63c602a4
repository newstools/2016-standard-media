Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said that Deputy President William Ruto is not guaranteed presidency in 2022. Kalonzo told the Kalenjin community not to believe what Jubilee Party stalwarts were saying regarding Ruto&rsquo;s presidency in the 2022 General Election. &ldquo;You should not be fooled that 2017 is a foregone conclusion and now we must focus on 2022. It is only God who knows about who will be president then,&rdquo; he said. He said it was ironical that the deputy president was going around the country telling leaders from other political parties that Jubilee was strong and intact yet he (Ruto) was losing popularity in his own backyard. &ldquo;He came to Ukambani and said that I Kalonzo was going nowhere with CORD and now we can see how people here (Bomet) have lost faith in Jubilee and are now with Governor Ruto in Mashinani party. You Kalenjin should not be misled by one individual. You should vote with your conscience,&rdquo; he said. Kalonzo said he was ready to work with Governor Ruto and other Kalenjin leaders.
