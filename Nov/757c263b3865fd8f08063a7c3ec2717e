Kenya&#39;s Family Bank said on Thursday its profit for this year is likely to fall by at least 25 percent due to higher funding costs and expenses associated with a round of job cuts.The mid-tier lender, whose shares are traded on the Nairobi Securities Exchange&#39;s Over-The-Counter market, said its pre-tax profit for the first nine months of this year plunged 46.6 percent to 1.45 billion shillings ($14.24 million), after costs rose.The bank is cutting an unspecified number of jobs to contain costs. Prospects for Kenyan lenders dimmed in August when the government capped commercial lending rates and set a minimum deposit rate.
