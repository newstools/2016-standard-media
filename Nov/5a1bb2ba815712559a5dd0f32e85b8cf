Some 57 military recruits who reported for training at Moi Barracks have been arrested over fake admission letters.According to a list in possession of the police, the 57 persons were arrested by the military police on October 3 when they were checking in at the Recruits Training School (RTS). Eldoret West Director of Criminal Investigations Officer (DCIO) Ali Samatar told the Press that the 57 were accused of fraudulently acquiring recruitment letters.&quot;The group comprises men and women from across the country and it was detected that their calling letters had anomalies and had not been genuinely issued by the State Department for Defence. We are liaising with the military officers to establish the source of their letters,&quot; said Mr Samatar.The 57 are helping the police to trace the origin of the letters, saying that action would be taken once investigations are complete.&quot;From preliminary investigations, we have established that parents and brokers who masquerade as senior military and police officials were involved in one way or another. We are taking strategic measures to ensure everybody in the racket faces the law,&quot; added Samatar.One of the letters seen by&nbsp;The Standard&nbsp;was printed on a cream piece of paper with a letterhead of the Ministry of Defence and the Court of Arms logo together with a seal on the bottom part.&quot;I am pleased to inform you that you have been successful in the interview and you have been recruited to the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) as a recruit. You are, therefore, required to report at the Recruits Training School in Eldoret, 23km from Eldoret town on the Eldoret-Kitale Road on Sunday 30, not later than 0800 hours for the final examination...,&quot; read part of the letter.Mr Ali said some of the arrested had successfully gone through the training exercise that took place between September 19, 2016 and October 18, 2016 in various selected centres countrywide.&quot;We have not arrested any suspect in line with the distribution of these letters but we are optimistic that we will do so after investigating the arrested persons,&quot; he said.Uasin Gishu acting County Police Commandant Nelson Taliti had earlier said over 70 recruits and two civilians had been arrested.Norman Simotwo, whose kin was among the arrested said his kin had gone through the normal recruitment procedure on October 3 in Kapsokwony.He, however, failed to explain where exactly his relative had received the calling letter from, reiterating that it was a letter from the State.
