Calls for Opposition unity&nbsp;echoed across the South Rift region&nbsp;with key leaders saying it is&nbsp;the only way to defeat the Jubilee&nbsp;government in next year&rsquo;s General&nbsp;Election. Wiper leader and CORD&nbsp;co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka&nbsp;led Kanu, Amani National Congress&nbsp;(ANC), Chama Cha Mashinani,&nbsp;ODM and Third-Way Alliance&nbsp;party leaders yesterday in&nbsp;calling for all like-minded parties&nbsp;to come together. Speaking at the thanksgiving&nbsp;service for Bomet Governor Isaac&nbsp;Ruto who broke his nose when police fired a tear gas canister at him during a youth soccer tournament, Kalonzo told a crowd that gathered at Bomet Stadium yesterday that the Opposition leaders were ready to work together and send&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;home. &ldquo;As my brothers have stated here, we stand a high chance of sending&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;home if we unite and support one person to face them at the polls so that we can end the miseries Kenyans were facing under this administration,&rdquo; Kalonzo said. POLITICAL INTOLERANCE The former vice president&nbsp;condemned the brutality meted out on Governor Ruto by police, saying such political intolerance was clawing back the gains the country had attained towards being a democratic state.

Elected leaders must be respected and allowed to carry out their political activities in a peaceful environment devoid of violence, he said.&rdquo; ANC Leader Musalia Mudavadi said he had heard the rallying call for unity, adding he will be at the forefront to ensure that it succeeds. &ldquo;For us to end corruption in this country, stop undemocratic practices and give Kenyans hope for a good future... We can only do this through formation of NASA,&rdquo; said the one time vice president who also served as a deputy primary minister in the grand coalition government. NASA is an acronym of the proposed National&nbsp;Super&nbsp;Alliance. Mudavadi said the National Youth Service (NYS) scam, the alleged Sh5 billion scandal at Afya House, the Standard Gauge Railway and other scandals in the&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;government are the reasons why Uhuruto must go home.
