In yesterday&#39;s edition of The Standard, we made reference to a company known as Estama Investment Ltd, and inadvertently reported that it is associated with the family of former Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) chairman,&nbsp;Mr Philip Kinisu.We would like to take this earliest opportunity to clarify that Mr Kinisu has no association with Estama Investment Ltd.&nbsp;
