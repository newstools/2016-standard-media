CORD leader Raila Odinga is today expected to visit the volatile Kerio Valley that has been hit by violence linked to cattle rustling.The former Prime Minister will address residents of Chesongoch in Elgeyo Marakwet County that borders Marakwet and Pokot. Raila&#39;s visit is being seen as a platform to castigate the Jubilee administration for the slow pace in ending inter-community conflict.The ongoing fighting between the Pokot and Marakwet communities over pasture and the theft of animals has left people dead and displaced others who have sought refuge in caves. Confirming the planned visit, ODM Marakwet branch chairman Samwel Chemweno said the Opposition leader would meet with and console the families that have borne the brunt of the conflict.&quot;His visit comes at a time when the national government is unwilling to end the killings. We have continued to bury victims while our leaders keep quiet. We expect the former premier to take the Jubilee administration to task,&quot; he said.&nbsp;URGENT CONCERNMr Chemweno said the tour was preceded by ODM&#39;s governing council meeting at which insecurity in Kerio Valley was noted as an urgent concern.&quot;Raila&#39;s visit will be a follow-up of the council meeting where I raised the matter of continued killings in our region. We cannot keep quiet when the local residents are not at peace,&quot; he noted.The CORD co-principal&#39;s visit comes a day after the Ministry of Devolution, through the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA), distributed food to the affected families in Marakwet West and East constituencies.David Kimosop, the KVDA managing director, who oversaw the distribution of 300 bags of maize, 200 bags of beans and 50 cartons of oil, said the food was a stopgap measure as the Government sought better ways to address the situation.Many residents in the mainly agricultural region have abandoned their farms hence necessitating the relief food.&quot;The worst affected are children,&quot; said Mr Kimosop.Keiyo-Marakwet ODM deputy vice chairman Micah Kigen blamed the leaders of the two communities for failing to engage in constructive talks to end the conflicts that have threatened development in the area.&quot;The only solution is good leadership. It is unfortunate that some of them are currently following Deputy President William Ruto as he traverses the country while their own people are living in caves and crying for aid,&quot; said Mr Kigen.
