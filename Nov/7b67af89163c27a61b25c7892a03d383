Kajiado County Assembly agriculture committee has raised concerns over effects of a weed that has adversely affected livestock keeping in parts of Magadi Ward. The weed is locally known as Mathenge (Prosopis juliflora). The&nbsp;Sectoral Committee on Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, in a report tabled by the Chairman John Wanyoike, is now calling for action and intervention on the fast-spreading weed in the area. &quot;This weed is causing much harm to locals and needs to be eradicated,&quot; said Diana Mepukori, the vice chair of the committee who seconded the motion. Magadi MCA Peter Pariken said the locals have for years been affected by the weed that is spreading very fast and suppressing many plants, including fodder and grass. &quot;Livestock farming is in danger yet it is the main economic activity in this ward,&quot; said Mr Pariken.
