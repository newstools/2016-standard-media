Six more suspects have been arrested over last month&#39;s killing of a farmer in Kosovo area of Naivasha. The arrest brings to nine suspects in custody as tension continued to mount in the area that has for years experienced clashes over ownership of the ADC land. Naivasha Deputy County Commissioner Isaac Masinde said an uneasy calm had returned to the area. &quot;We believe the six have something to do with the murder,&quot; he said. A G3 rifle used in the killing is still being looked for.
