Taita-Taveta&nbsp;Senator&nbsp;Dan Mwazo has&nbsp;endorsed&nbsp;Wiper Democratic Movement leader&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;Musyoka as the&nbsp;presidential&nbsp;bid on a&nbsp;CORD&nbsp;ticket. The&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;legislator, who has persistently skipped the party leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s tours of the region, yesterday turned up at a&nbsp;Kalonzo&rsquo;s&nbsp;rally in Taita Taveta county. Mwazo said&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;had informed him of his tour of the county unlike &ldquo;others&rdquo; who visited the area. &ldquo;Mr&nbsp;Kalonzo&nbsp;called and informed me that he was touring the county to seek for votes and that is why I am accompanying him to tell the electorate that he is the best candidate for the presidency,&rdquo; he told the rally. &ldquo;There are some leaders who have been visiting the county to seek support without involving local leaders,&rdquo; added Mwazo without mentioning names.

Wiper Secretary General Hassan Omar said&nbsp;CORD&nbsp;was firm and will deliver the presidency next year. &ldquo;We are together and we will remain together in 2017,&rdquo; he said.The Mombasa&nbsp;Senator&nbsp;accused the Jubilee government of perpetrating corruption, tribalism and marginalizing some Kenyans in employment and resource allocation. &ldquo;We are ready to remove the corrupt government from power to put in place an accountable leadership that will address myriad problems facing Kenyans like poverty and unemployment, and the thorny squatter issue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Food prices are skyrocketing. The only thing that will save Kenyan is change of leaders in the management of the country&rsquo;s affairs.&nbsp;CORD&nbsp;is the only hope for Kenyans,&rdquo; said Omar. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
