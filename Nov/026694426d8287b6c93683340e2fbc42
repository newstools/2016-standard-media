Healthcare services at the Murang&rsquo;a County Referral Hospital were disrupted after staff joined casual workers in protests demanding their unpaid September and October dues. The workers representatives said they had been assured that their salaries would be ready but by Thursday evening they had not received any pay. &ldquo;We have to fight for our rights because we have families to support,&rdquo; said a representative who declined to be named. It was a sad scenario because other services were also brought to a standstill. Inpatients, for example, were not served breakfast. A visit to the wards revealed the pathetic state of the facility with dirty water flooding all over. In the female ward, there was a dead body that had remained uncollected while dirty linens littered on the floors of all the wards.

However, County Secretary Patrick Mukuria intervened and the morgue was eventually opened. He urged the striking workers to keep calm and assured them that their woes would be addressed soon. Mukuria said services had resumed after the workers ascertained their salaries had been remitted. &ldquo;There is need for honesty as the county government fulfilled its pledge and all the employees had received their salaries as we had agreed during a round-table meeting on Tuesday,&rdquo; said Mukuria. Police guarded the facility to avert chaos. Last year, the casual workers had gone on strike prompting Governor Mwangi wa Iria to order prompt payment of their dues.
