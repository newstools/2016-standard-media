A court refused to adjourn a case in which a father is charged with impregnating his daughter five years ago. The court&#39;s decision came after the investigating officer, who was the final prosecution witness, failed to turn up. The court has repeatedly summoned Walter Menjo since October last year to testify in a case where Simon Kituyi Wakape is charged with incest. Wakape is accused of committing the offence on May 14, 2011 in Milimani village in Bungoma County. The girl, who was 16 when the offence occurred, had earlier told the court how her father took her away after the death of her mother, promising to enroll her in a better secondary school. Two days later, he is alleged to have defiled her and locked her up in his house. The Government chemist testified in October last year that DNA test results had confirmed that the girl&#39;s child was sired by her father; but the investigating officer failed to turn up to give his testimony.
