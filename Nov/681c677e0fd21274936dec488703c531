NAKURU: The appointment of Nakuru County Speaker Susan Kihika as a member of the Jubilee presidential campaign team in Rift Valley has elicited mixed reaction from party supporters across the region.While a large number of party supporters endorsed the decision by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, a section of local leaders said she was not up to the task.&quot;Ms Kihika is a junior politician in Rift Valley politics to be bestowed with such a huge task. That role deserves someone who is politically mature who is capable of rally all Jubilee supporters and followers in the rift valley behind the president and his deputy ahead of the next general election,&quot; said a local MP. The legislator who did not wish to be named so as not to be seen as antagonising the President and his deputy, questioned the decision by the party leadership to pick Kihika saying the Jubilee leadership should have consulted widely.But Nakuru Senator James Mungai lauded Mr Kenyatta for picking the campaign team saying 1the decision will permanently solve the disquiet and wrangles currently simmering especially at the county level as politicians position themselves for the impending 2017 polls.Mr Mungai who has since announced his intention to gun for the governorship of Nakuru County, challenged the team to with all leaders in ensuring that Jubilee carries the day in the August 8 General Elections.Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria said the campaign team must work towards bringing together all factions that emerged after the merger of the 12 Jubilee affiliated political parties.&quot;The campaign must first by bringing the factions together especially in Nakuru County where we had started to see divisions over the party leadership,&quot; he said.Last month, chaos erupted at a meeting convened by a Naivasha politician James Karimi at the defunct TNA offices in Nakuru. Karimi was accused of organizing the meeting to impose a county Jubilee Party chairperson.At the same time, Gikaria who is a member of the Jubilee Party expressed optimism that the nomination process will be free and fair.&quot;I truly believe that the leaders of Jubilee have committed themselves to a free and fair process. This will allow the party to grow. It&#39;s a democratic party and I truly believe the leaders are committed to it,&quot; he added.Former Nakuru TNA chairman Abdul Noor also welcomed Kihika&#39;s appointment but challenged her to proof herself by uniting local leaders who were sharply divided over the local JP leadership.&quot;She (KIhikia) has a perfect opportunity to unite all the leaders in the county under Jubilee and she must prove her worth in terms of leadership if she wants to earn respect like her late father Kihika Kimani,&quot; Mr Noor said.On her part, Ms Kihika said she was excited about her new responsibility and that her first assignment, as the president&#39;s campaigner in the region is to unite all the leaders under Jubilee Party&#39;s to ensure President Kenyatta and his deputy are re-elected.&ldquo;I am happy to know that the president and his deputy have faith in me. I am d1etermined to ensure sure that the presidential campaign in the region runs smoothly and everyone is on board.&quot; She said adding that she feels the weight on her shoulders but she is equal to the task.Kihika who is contesting the Nakuru County senate&rsquo;s seat in the coming elections, said her work is well cut out for her and now she that she has double responsibilities of campaigning for the presidency and herself &ndash; she has to work extra harder.The daughter of the late veteran politician, said she understands what is at stake and she would reach out to everyone to ensure the campaigns are a success.&ldquo;I want to leave the best legacy for the president and his deputy by ensuring a smooth and successful campaign because this is a rare opportunity for me,&quot; Kihika said.The council that was led by President Kenyatta and his deputy Ruto at the Bomas of Kenya failed to name interim party officials for the new party as expected but instead went ahead to name a national presidential campaign team.Mr Ruto told the more than 3,000 delegates that the party would now hold grass root elections 90 days after the 2017 General Election.Ruto announced that the party had selected a group of individuals to lead and plan the party&#39;s campaigns and manifesto.The team is set to meet Kenyatta yesterday to strategize on how the campaigns will be carried out across the country ahead of the 2017 Elections.The DP also stated that Jubilee Party officials will be named after three months, adding that nominations for the party will be conducted by the IEBC.The list unveiled includes Governors, Senators, Members of Parliament (MPs) and Women Representatives.
