Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua has finally declared her support for the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Karua who has been flirting with the Opposition however said she would stick with her party, which she will use to vie for the Kirinyaga gubernatorial seat. Karua said since Kirinyaga was totally behind Uhuru, she had no option than to join the majority as the rule dictates and the Kenyatta tide was too strong for anyone to go against. She explained, &#39;&#39;I must state here and clearly that my support and that of my party is towards the presidential candidature of Uhuru Kenyatta, while I do not support the CORD or the supper alliance,&#39;&#39; she declared. She has also distanced herself and Narc-Kenya from the much touted Supper Alliance comprising of the ODM, Wiper and Amani party. &#39;&#39;Narc-kenya has just been friends with the opposition for the sole purpose of fighting the high levels of corruption and nothing beyond that, and those linking myself or our party with the so called Supper Alliance are just engaging in witch-hunting,&#39;&#39; she said.
