Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth (right) says detaining suspects in the course of their trial would be a good way to rid the country of corruption. Kenneth who has announced plans to vie for governorship and support President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election bid challenged MPs to write a law that will ensure those implicated in scandals do not roam the streets freely before they are cleared. &quot;It takes passing of a law stating anybody involved in stealing Government assets should be put in remand and not given bond or bail. You will see that people will stop stealing,&quot; said Kenneth. Kenneth who spoke during a fund-raiser at African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Dandora yesterday challenged Embakasi North MP James Mwangi Gakuyu, who was present, to take the lead.
