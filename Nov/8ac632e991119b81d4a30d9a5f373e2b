Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwamba has accused Opposition chief Raila Odinga of applying double standards on corruption matters. The Budalang&rsquo;i MP said corruption should be condemned anywhere it has occurred whether in national government or at the counties. He accused the Opposition of only condemning corruption at the national government but failing to point an accusing finger when the same happens at the counties led by their members.
