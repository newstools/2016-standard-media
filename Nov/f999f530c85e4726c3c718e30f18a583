Laikipia, Kenya: A man has been arrested after he was found with fake work permits valued at Sh2.7 million. The suspect was arrested in Rumuruti area, Laikipia County after being on the run for months. He had been selling the permits to Chinese experts in the country, immigration officials said. Officials said Solomon Joloimet was arrested after the nine Chinese nationals filed a complaint with the immigration department saying he had promised to give them the documents at a fee in vain. Head of investigations at the immigration department said Joloimet had issued the fake permits to the foreigners but denied any possibility that the suspect was working with insiders in the department.
