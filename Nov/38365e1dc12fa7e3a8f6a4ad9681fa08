The Mass was also a shot in the arm to Sweden&#39;s small Catholic community, which numbers only about 150,000 out of a population of about 10 million. That total is less than the attendance for some papal ceremonies in Rome. &quot;A decade or so ago, people were even uneasy about wearing crosses, having to explain to Swedes who did not understand,&quot; Josephine Kabogoza-Muksoke, a Ugandan-born Catholic, said as the pope drove by in a golf cart around Malmo stadium &nbsp; &quot;That isn&#39;t so now. Catholics have more confidence and there are more of us - thanks to immigration.&quot; &nbsp; ACCEPTANCE AND CRITICISM OF IMMIGRATION GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
