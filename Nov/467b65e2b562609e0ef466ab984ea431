Chiefs have been urged to embrace social media platforms to combat crime and maintain law and order. Joseph Kaguthi, the Nyumba Kumi initiative chairman said that as the world develops it is ideal for chiefs to be at the forefront to maximise communication channels such as Twitter, Telegram and WhatsApp to reach a large audience and share crucial information that may help combat criminal activities.
