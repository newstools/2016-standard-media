A section of residents want the county assembly investigated over&nbsp;questionable spending. The residents yesterday delivered a petition to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) regional offices in Nyeri demanding action against the assembly, which they accused of scheming to loot public coffers. &quot;Our county has been in the limelight over questionable activities that have made the public question the leadership of the county assembly,&quot; they said in a statement. They further accused the assembly of infighting, disunity and antagonising other arms of the county government. Rware Ward leader Amos Muchiri said the county assembly was operating unchecked and called for the prosecution of two MCAs who he said were involved in graft. Some of questionable spending raised by Auditor General&nbsp;Edward Ouko includes the recruitment of staff and rent payment for ward offices.
