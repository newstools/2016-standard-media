Prominent Uasin Gishu politician Jackson Kibor&rsquo;s wife has denied deserting her husband and restricting his conjugal rights.Kibor 82, moved to court on June 17, 2014 seeking to divorce his second wife, Josephine Jepkoech, after 51 years of marriage over alleged desertion and cruelty. In his petition, Kibor says Jepkoech, with whom according to a marriage certificate approved under the Colony and Protectorate Law of Kenya he was united on February 27, 1965, was disrespectful and chased him from their Kipkabus Farm.&ldquo;Since the celebration of the marriage, the petitioner lived with the wife until November 2003 when the petitioner left the matrimonial home as a result of cruelty and in-hospitability by the respondent,&rdquo; read part of the petition by Kibor.In his petition, Kibor accused his wife of denying him conjugal rights and showing disinterest in their marriage, thereby leaving him in loneliness, mental anguish and psychological torture.
