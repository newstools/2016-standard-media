The public hearing was organised by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR).Mr Yakub Hajj Tita, a resident of Kone village, told the commission three KWS officers crushed his genitals after they found him in possession of alleged game meat at Drift near Garsen.He said although the meat was from a cow he slaughtered after it had broken its leg in the grazing field, the officers insisted it was bushmeat.&quot;The officers broke my arm and collar bone and took me to Garsen Police Station.
