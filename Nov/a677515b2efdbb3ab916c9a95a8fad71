Jubilee Party aspirants and current elected leaders have been urged to support President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election bid even if it means losing their own contests. Next year&rsquo;s General Election has been billed as the most-competitive in Kenya&rsquo;s history, especially for the president as Jubilee and CORD leaders traverse the country, seeking votes. &nbsp;Speaking in Embakasi East yesterday, aspiring MP Francis Mureithi said President Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election should be the priority for all Jubilee supporters. &ldquo;I urge all leaders seeking seats and those already in office to put the presidential contest first before individual bids. Next year&rsquo;s elections will not be a walkover for anyone,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp; &nbsp; READ MORE Martha Karua quits Raila&rsquo;s team, declares her support for Uhuru Intrigues behind President Uhuru's choice of Tuju as his man Kenya steps up campaign for Amina's AU job
