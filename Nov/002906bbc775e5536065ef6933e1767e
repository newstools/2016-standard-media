US Ambassador Robert Godec has now asked the government to prioritise the fight against corruption. Mr Godec said corruption continues to undermine the future of the country, and that the vice was denying Kenyans the right to quality service delivery and maximum benefits from their taxes. The ambassador expressed concern over the slow pace of handling graft cases in the country, saying there was need for the Government to strengthen its accountability systems to tame the vice. With the Government fighting to explain the alleged loss of Sh5.5 billion at the Ministry of Health, Godec said the relevant authorities must quickly investigate and have the culprits held accountable for their actions.
