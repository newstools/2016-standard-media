Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard&nbsp;Kiala&#39;s&nbsp;daughter&nbsp;was&nbsp;found&nbsp;unhurt in Sunton, Nairobi, after claims she had been kidnapped. Kathleen Nduku was tracked to a house where she was&nbsp;found&nbsp;alone and later taken for questioning by police. Police officers who&nbsp;found&nbsp;her said they were investigating to establish whether Ms Nduku was kidnapped for political reasons as claimed. &quot;She is under interrogation to know if indeed she was kidnapped as claimed,&quot; said Nairobi DCI Nicholas Kamwende. Mr Kamwende said preliminary findings did not point to a case of kidnapping but they were digging some more. &quot;Maybe she was resting at a friend&#39;s place but we are still investigating,&quot; he said.
