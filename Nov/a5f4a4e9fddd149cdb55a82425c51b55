Emurua Dikirr MP Johanna Ngeno has dismissed a recent summon by police in Kilgoris. He said police should stop being used to try and silence him. Speaking when he joined residents of Siongiroi in a protest match, the MP said he was ready to be arrested but would not be silenced for criticising the Government. &ldquo;I have been arrested and held even in Tanzania for fighting for the rights of my people and these summons will not stop me from playing my role as a leader. I will not give in to threats even if they use GSU to come for me, my position will not change,&rdquo; Mr Ngeno told a cheering crowd. He said it was regrettable that Jubilee was resorting to unacceptable means to tame politicians who are opposed to it. The MP who was accompanied by nominated MCA Nancy Bii said his stand will not change warning Jubilee against playing dirty politics. He said the recent attack on Governor Ruto was a clear indication that Jubilee was not ready for criticism. &ldquo;What happened to Ruto at Silibwet is an indicator and they should know voters are not foolish,&rdquo; he said.
