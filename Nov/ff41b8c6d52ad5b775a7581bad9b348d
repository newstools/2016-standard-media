Robert Kiplagat JENIPHER WACHIE Robert Amalemba HAROLD ODHIAMBO &ndash; Mon, 31. October 2016 2:46 PM &ndash; Teacher on spot/KCPE registrationTeacher refuses to register 7 pregnant pupils for KCPE exam A primary school head teacher refused to register seven girls for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations because they were pregnant.The head teacher of Sonkoro Primary school in Narok North declined to register the pupils after six of them tested positive for pregnancy.The seventh, a 15-year-old who had been thrown out of school on suspicion that she was pregnant, turned out negative. However, she will not sit for the national examinations that begin today because she too was not registered.Her father, Solomon Sopia, said he only learnt that his daughter was not registered for the exams on Friday.&ldquo;During registration, seven students, among them my daughter, were expelled on claims that they were pregnant. I did not believe that she was pregnant so I took her to Narok District hospital were she was found not pregnant,&rdquo;said Mr Sopia.&ldquo;I had paid everything that was required and I thought she had been registered,&rdquo; he said.Confronted by the angry father, the head teacher fled on his motorbike.Area Sub-County Education Officer Kuyo Kasaoina, who was equally surprised by the incident, vowed to discipline the head teacher, saying his actions were illegal.&ldquo;This is outrageous. It is illegal for a head teacher to deny any child registration on the basis of pregnancy,&rdquo; he said.In Nairobi, teachers and KCPE candidates were in an upbeat mood ahead of the examinations.&nbsp;SCHOOL COMPOUND&ldquo;The examinations are no different from any other, except that no teachers or visitors will be allowed in the school compound once they begin. And candidates are not allowed to carry geometrical sets or clipboards,&rdquo; said City Primary School head teacher Regina Mulwa.In Kisumu County, candidates exuded confidence about passing the exams.&ldquo;We have been prepared well by our teachers and I am optimistic that we are going to do well,&rdquo; said Casey Williams, a candidate at Hekima Primary School.A spot check by The Standard established that preparations for the exams were complete, with both invigilators and pupils ready.Yesterday, a number of candidates were busy with last-minute revision after rehearsals. Others were seeking divine intervention through special prayers.Teachers at Hekima, which will be doing the national examinations for the third time since its inception, also commended the Ministry of Education for the measures put in place to curb cheating.&ldquo;We have prepared our candidates well and we are optimistic that the examinations will go well,&rdquo; said Peter Okello, the head teacher.The Kenya National Examination Council (Knec) has sealed all loopholes in a bid to stop a replica of last year&rsquo;s examinations, which saw several cases of cheating.Nyanza Regional Education Co-ordinator Richard Chepkawai said his office had made all the necessary arrangements for the examinations.&ldquo;We are prepared in all the counties and we know that the examinations are poised to run smoothly, with no cases of cheating,&rdquo; said Mr Chepkawai.In Kakamega County, teachers supported the new examination guidelines, saying they would tame rampant cheating.&nbsp;LEVEL FIELDKakamega Primary School head teacher David Ikunza said the guidelines would create a level playing field for all candidates.&ldquo;The good thing this year is the strong measures to stop exam cheating. Our pupils and teachers feel the same because the field will be level,&rdquo; said Mr Ikunza.Evelyn Tiany, the director of Applegate School in Kakamega, said the new regulations would be reflected in the results.&ldquo;I am ready to get shocked by the results next year. I know the so-called academic giants will be a shadow of themselves. The high marks we are used to seeing will be thing of the past,&rdquo; she said.At Kakamega GK Prison, where candidates&nbsp; scored a mean of 366 in last year&rsquo;s KCPE, 25 inmates were optimistic that they would hit the 400 mark this year.Of the 25, three are serving life sentences.According to the prison boss, Superintendent Nicholas Emasse, the inmates have been exempted from the regular prison duty roster and have been on a special diet for the past two weeks.&ldquo;We have not had any cheating here; if the problem is curbed, then our candidates will shine even more,&rdquo; he said.
