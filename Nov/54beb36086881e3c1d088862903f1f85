New rules to govern the marking of national examinations have been announced.This is in line with the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s concerted effort to protect the credibility of both primary and secondary school examination results.&nbsp;The rules cover the conduct of examiners, including a ban on the use of electronic gadgets inside marking centres, restrictions on access to the marking centres by unauthorised persons and barring taking exam materials from the centres. Others include limiting the venues of marking centres to a few in Nairobi and neighboring regions like Machakos and Muranga, stepping up surveillance and requiring examiners to declare centres where conflict of interest might arise.The Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) released the strict marking rules on Wednesday, as the three-day standard eight examinations end today.The keenly scripted regulations spell out the conduct of all contracted examiners from their reporting date to the marking centers complete with payment claims procedures that must be strictly followed.And more pressure has been put on senior examiners whose contract with the council will only be honoured &#39;after successful marking and submission of the Chief Examiner Report to KNEC&#39;.Under the regulations, all the examiners will be required not to disclose their identity as markers or divulge any information acquired in the course of their work.The marking sessions will start at 7am and end at 7pm daily during the entire marking period.The document signed by the acting KNEC&nbsp;Chief Executive Officer Mercy Karogo does not indicate when marking will begin.It, however, advises examiners to confirm their availability for marking by November 4 (for KCPE) and November 25 (for KCSE).The council contracts up to 24,000 teachers to mark examinations and are paid per number of scripts they process. About Sh1.7 billion is spent during the marking.Once marking starts, no examiner will be allowed to carry away the council question paper, marking scheme&nbsp;and other marking materials either in their original form or photocopies.&quot;All examiners are expected to reside in the marking centres, unless with clearance from KNEC,&quot; reads the regulations.The document says it will be the responsibility of each commuting examiner using own vehicle to a marking centre to ensure the council staff on daily basis records their vehicle.&quot;Examiners allowed to use their own vehicles to the marking centre must present the vehicle&#39;s original log book to the centre organisers and the current duplicate insurance certificate for verification during the actual marking,&quot; read the regulations in part.And commuter examiners using public means will be required to sign in on daily basis. &quot;Failure to do so may result in the claim not being honoured for payment,&quot; says Ms Karogo.Finer details show that examiners&#39; marking rooms and hostels will be a no-go-zone for unauthorised visitors and no examiner will be allowed to carry personal electronic gadgets, like laptops and tablets to the marking centres.The examiners will also not be allowed to carry away answer scripts, marking schemes or any marking materials from the marking rooms or centres and neither will they be allowed to bring in any unauthorised materials.Knec says all marking must be done in the specified rooms at the marking centres.&quot;Any examiner found contravening this regulation will be dismissed instantly and a report made to his/her employer for disciplinary action. Where there is need to work beyond these hours, the chief examiner should liaise with Knec for extension,&quot; reads the rules.The centres will also be closed to members of the media and examiners have been warned not to discuss marking and other welfare issues with the Press or other unauthorised persons.The examiners will also not post pictures or share any information through the social media platforms during and after the marking exercise.&quot;Any examiner found contravening this regulation shall be instantly dismissed,&quot; says Knec.And as is the case with candidates, every person getting into or out of a marking centre shall be subjected to security check/frisking at the gate.The council has also banned use of mobile phones in the marking rooms, script rooms and e-capture rooms.&quot;They will, however, use the phones during tea or lunch breaks outside the rooms,&quot; says Knec.
