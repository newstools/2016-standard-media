After months of speculation, nominated MP Oburu Oginga has declared that he will contest the Bondo parliamentary seat in 2017. Last year, his supporters warned his critics to write him off at their own peril. They said those claiming that Mr Oburu was too old to run for a political seat should look at his development record. &ldquo;Age doesn&rsquo;t matter so long as one has the necessary experience to lead,&rdquo; said George Mawere, the Bondo sub-county ODM Organising Secretary. On Saturday during the burial of Jalang&rsquo;o Okumu in Nyang&rsquo;oma village, Oburu said he would make a political comeback after his gubernatorial attempt in 2013. &ldquo;A lot of things have been said about my candidature. I would like to set the record straight that I am going to contest the Bondo parliamentary seat and not the gubernatorial seat next year,&rdquo; he said. He said he was also committed to campaigning for CORD leader Raila Odinga in his bid for presidency in 2017.
