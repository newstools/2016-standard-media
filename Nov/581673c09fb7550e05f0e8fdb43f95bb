Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta, his deputy William Ruto and Opposition leader Raila Odinga to urgently deal with the runaway corruption. The Ford Kenya Deputy Party leader has lamented that the three leaders are merely playing lip service to the vice rather than &ldquo;shedding blood&rdquo; of the corrupt who appear close to their political hearts. He took issue with the President who was attending a funeral in Busia to state government&rsquo;s attempt to stem the vice. He at the same time called on Raila to speak about the latest scandal in Kilifi County. &nbsp;
