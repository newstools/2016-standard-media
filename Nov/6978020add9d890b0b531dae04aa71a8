Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett has urged smallholder farmers in Kwale County to venture into cotton farming to help revive the troubled sector. Speaking during a visit to Base Titanium mining firm at the weekend, the CS said there are various challenges in the Kenyan cotton sector that have resulted in low competitiveness, both in the local and in the international markets. He said the Government is, however, keen to reverse the situation starting with increasing farmers&rsquo; output. &ldquo;One major constraint is the high cost of inputs. However, since the inception of revival initiatives, the Kenyan Government&rsquo;s emphasis has been on enhancing strong relationships with key stakeholders such as the farmers, input suppliers, market agents, ginners, spinners and textile millers to boost self-regulation and also promote not only production but also value and consumption of cotton,&rdquo; said Mr Bett. He said cotton farming has previously existed in Kwale County and acknowledged Base Titanium for reintroducing it as part of its CSR projects.
