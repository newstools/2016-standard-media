A student who was to sit the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination next week has been found dead. The badly mutilated body of Brian Ngatia, a Form Four student at Devki Ruiru Township Secondary School, was found dumped a few metres from their home in Gitothua near Ruiru prison. Ngatia, who had gone missing last Saturday, had severe injuries on his head and face. He also had some burns on his hands. According to his mother, Lydia Wambui, Ngatia went missing after an altercation with a parent from the school who accused him of stealing her daughter&#39;s mobile phone. Wambui alleged that the parent called on Saturday to say she had beaten up Ngatia for stealing her daughter&#39;s mobile phone; and that he had managed to escape. The mother of three said they never saw him alive again. &quot;My second born son woke me up telling me he had seen his brother lying in a ditch as he was coming back from buying breakfast,&quot; said Ms Wambui. She accused the police at Ruiru Police Station of turning her away when she first went to report her son&#39;s disappearance. &quot;They told us to go look for our child since we knew where he was,&quot; she said. The family questioned why the police had not questioned the parent who had an altercation with her son even after making a report to them. The Officer Commanding Station Christopher Kimiti said he had handed over the matter to the CID. Officer Commanding Police Division Isaac Thuranira declined to speak to the media. Teachers and students described Ngatia as humble and a bright student.
