Six people were Saturday killed and two others injured in fighting between two clans in Wajir County over a disputed boundary. The fighting took place in Baghala area when a group of men from Matan clan invaded their Jibril neighbours with an intention of an attack. Their planned raid had apparently leaked and they found the Jibril clan ready to counter attack. The Matan were shot at, forcing a number of them to retreat. Wajir County police boss Samuel Mukinda said the deceased were shot at using rifles. &ldquo;They were ambushed and shot dead by gunmen who had been waiting. It seems the other clan knew of the planned raid,&rdquo; said Mukinda. The police boss added they are investigating the incident with the aim of confiscating the weapons from those armed. He said the weapons are illegally in the hands of the locals.

Mukinda said more officers had been taken to the area to help contain the situation. The injured were taken to the Eldas Hospital with life threatening wounds. Such attacks are common in the area despite leaders&rsquo; efforts to stop them. The clans usually fight over boundaries and the situation worsens in election time. Mukinda said security meetings had been called to quell the situation and urged leaders to take a lead in containing tensions.
