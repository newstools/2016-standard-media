Meru Deputy Governor Raphael Muriungi has expressed interest in the Igembe South parliamentary seat during next year&#39;s General Election. Muriungi, who has announced he will not be Governor Peter Munya&#39;s running mate in 2017, said he will vie for the seat on a Democratic Party (DP) ticket. Speaking in Meru town Saturday, Muriungi said plans are underway to open more DP offices, including in Maua town. &quot;DP is a massive party with a huge following across Kenya and was retired President Mwai Kibaki&#39;s development vehicle. I ascribe to the development vision that it stands for,&quot; Muriungi said. He said education and agricultural development would be some of his priority areas.
