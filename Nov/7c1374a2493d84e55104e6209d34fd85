The suspects who appeared before Principal Magistrate Stephen Mogute are school principal Herman Masafu, examination supervisor Kennedy Kiberenge, teachers Roselyne Wakanya, Geofrey Musembu, Mary Wepukhulu, Isaac Toywa and David Wekesa.

And seven students who had been arrested together with the teachers were released and allowed to sit their examinations but they were asked to be reporting at Bungoma Police Station.

The suspects were caught by a Kenya National Examination Council (Knec) official who had visited the school. The Knec official alerted Bungoma County Director of Education Charles Anyika who rushed to the school accompanied by police officers and arrested the suspects. &quot;I found students with cheating materials, including books, that were hidden under their modified chairs.
