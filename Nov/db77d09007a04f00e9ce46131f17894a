JOHANNESBURG:&nbsp;South Africa&#39;s deputy finance minister said on Thursday that patronage and corruption were undermining efforts for a credible government, a day after an audit showed the government had made $3 billion in irregular expenditure this financial year. South Africa&#39;s political elite has been involved in a slew of corruption scandals which have eroded the trust of investors and weighed on Africa&#39;s most industrialised economy. Ratings agencies have warned of downgrades before the end of the year. Mcebisi Jonas&#39; remarks in a speech at a labour congress came a day after the auditor-general said irregular expenditure by government departments swelled 80 percent to 43.4 billion rand ($3 billion) in the 2015-16 financial year. &quot;Leadership that looks beyond its own narrow confines is needed,&quot; Jonas said, adding that &quot;patronage and corruption had undermined efforts to build a credible government&quot;. Last week President Jacob Zuma survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote over allegations of influence-peddling, one of several scandals involving him since taking office in 2009. The 74-year-old has shown no intention of wanting to resign. As deputy finance minister, Jonas has been an outspoken critic of government graft. In October he said &quot;Corruption is real, it&#39;s palpable, you can feel it.&quot; READ MORE Decision to keep tender saved Sh50m, court told Don in bid to stop hiring of anti-graft boss The most corrupt departments in Laikipia On Thursday he also said that ratings agencies were concerned about Pretoria&#39;s ability to maintain fiscal targets but Treasury had &quot;convinced them&quot; that it could maintain caps on spending. &quot;We&#39;ve done what could be done. My sense is that there is general acceptance of the constraints,&quot; Jonas told reporters after his speech.
