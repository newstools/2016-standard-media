Some hoteliers in South Coast are reluctant to take part in statistical data collection by a Government agency. Only 17 out of the 28 tourist hotels in the popular tourist destination co-operated with officials from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), Kwale assistant County Commissioner Kenneth Gitonga said yesterday. The official, who represented County Commissioner Kutswa Olaka at this year&#39;s celebrations to mark the African Statistics Day at Baraza Park, said officials from KNBS face difficulties accessing some of the hotels to collect data. The bureau often carries out research and survey in different parts of the country. &quot;The information we have is that the bureau has been facing challenges when dealing with some of the hoteliers who are among the major culprits in failing to provide data in this county,&quot; said Mr Gitonga.
