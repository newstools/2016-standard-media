Nairobi residents living in&nbsp;old&nbsp;and dilapidated council&nbsp;estates&nbsp;can look up to decent&nbsp;housing&nbsp;if they live to see completion of the urban renewal&nbsp;housing&nbsp;project to be signed next week. Detailed plans to redevelop at least seven&nbsp;estates&nbsp;seen by The Standard on Saturday promise &ldquo;a Nairobi of the 70&rsquo;s experience&rdquo; but with&nbsp;modern&nbsp;top-end&nbsp;housing&nbsp;units complete with&nbsp;modern&nbsp;recreational facilities. The Nairobi of the 70&rsquo;s had affordable and spacious&nbsp;housing&nbsp;with adequate recreational facilities within the&nbsp;estates, adequate parking, sufficient liquid and solid waste disposal system, fresh water supply and were properly planned to have markets and schools around or within them. All that was however lost to pressures of increased&nbsp;housing&nbsp;demands, swell of rural migrants seeking better opportunities and incapacity of successive council administrations to put up to demands for services. Singled out for re-development on a pilot basis from next week are Bachelors/Jevanjee, Ngong Road,&nbsp;Old&nbsp;Ngara, Pangani, Uhuru, New Ngara and Suna Road&nbsp;estates. These&nbsp;estates&nbsp;were built to counter colonial policy which had not factored African&rsquo;s living in the&nbsp;city. &ldquo;Most of these&nbsp;estates&nbsp;were developed long time ago and are therefore in poor conditions. Majority of them are also low rise occupying extensive lands which can be optimised by erecting middle to high rise apartments in line with&nbsp;city&nbsp;planning regulations,&rdquo; Governor Evans Kidero explains.

Now, both&nbsp;estates&nbsp;sitting on approximately 7.56 acres of prime land are shadows of their former selves attracting low income earners. Apart from their buildings being in deplorable state and occupying large portion of land, the access road to the property has been consumed by informal garages and kiosks which need to be tidied up. Old&nbsp;bungalows Ngong Road&nbsp;estate&nbsp;has retained most of the features of the 70&rsquo;s but is a waste of space according to current Nairobi County plans. Located near the Kenya Meteorological Department headquarters, the&nbsp;estate&nbsp;comprises of several&nbsp;old&nbsp;bungalow units sparsely scattered in 46.35 acres of land. The county wants to put up high rise buildings to stop the waste of land and to afford&nbsp;city&nbsp;residents more&nbsp;houses. Old&nbsp;Ngara is possibly the closest&nbsp;estate&nbsp;to the&nbsp;city&nbsp;centre. It&rsquo;s located along Musindi Road, behind Equity Bank Ngara branch and north of Nairobi River. Currently, the&nbsp;estate&nbsp;comprises of a main one-bed-roomed block baptised &ldquo;Fort Jesus&rdquo; by locals for its fortress and forbearing looks. Fort Jesus is flanked by eight blocks on one side and seven blocks on the other which are an assortment of two and three bed-room units. At their prime in the 70&rsquo;s and citing on 3.5 acres of prime land a walking distant from the&nbsp;city&nbsp;centre, the storey buildings must have been the place for hippy Nairobians. But now, the buildings- including Fort Jesus have been condemned by the Kidero administration as &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo; and must come down for new ones. Pangani&nbsp;estate&nbsp;adjacent to Pangani police station has retained some of its&nbsp;old&nbsp;features and could be retained were it not for want of space. Sitting on 4.92 acres of land, the&nbsp;estatecomprises of 12 blocks each with four, two bed-roomed units. Each block has a servant quarter made of four rooms. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
