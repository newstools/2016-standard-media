Parents have been urged to enroll their children in polytechnics as opposed to costly university education. The principal of Meru National Polytechnic Geoffrey Rukunja notes that the youth&#39;s chances of getting employment lies in the polytechnics, since the courses offered are marketable. He said that unlike universities, the courses at polytechnics are shorter and significantly cheaper, hence within reach of most parents. Speaking during the institute&#39;s fifth graduation yesterday, Rukunja observed that the perception that polytechnics were meant for less bright students, said courses such as beauty, tailoring, carpentry, mechanical and electrical engineering, were in great demand. He said while university education has always been viewed as better, opportunities available after attaining technical skills abound.
