By-elections in two counties and six constituencies loom large after ODM yesterday wrote to relevant bodies to declare 10 seats held by rebel leaders vacant.But some of the targeted leaders indicated they plan to engage the Raila Odinga-led party in bruising legal battle.ODM Executive Director Oduor Ong&rsquo;wen yesterday wrote to the Registrar of Political Parties to delist its rebel leaders from its membership register. The party also wrote to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), National Assembly Speaker and Speaker of Nairobi County Assembly asking them to declare the seats vacant to prompt by-elections.Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&rsquo;u told The Standard she has seven days to act on the request starting yesterday.According to the Political Parties Amendment Act, the registrar is expected to de-register expelled members within seven days upon receiving a political party&rsquo;s resolution to expel its members.And IEBC said once the seats are declared vacant by the speakers of the affected Houses, it would proceed to set election dates, stating that it is straight-forward case just like any other by-elections.Expelled ODM rebel governor and MPs yesterday wrote to the party through their lawyer Kioko Kilukumi seeking for a review on the party&rsquo;s decision to kick them from the party.Mr Kilukumi, in his letter to the party, wants ODM to convene a special National Governing Council to relook into the recommendations by the party&rsquo;s National Disciplinary Committee, which was ratified NGC on Monday.DECISION FINALODM confirmed receipt of the letter but said its Monday decision was final.According to ODM constitution, a member is allowed to appeal a decision made against them by the party.And former Law Society of Kenya Executive Officer Apollo Mboya noted that there was a lacuna in the law in regards to the position of deputy governor.He cited ambiguity in the law when it comes to replacing a deputy county boss, who is elected together with the governor.&ldquo;It would present a dilemma because deputy governor is not directly elected by the people,&rdquo; said Mr Mboya.On Monday, ODM National Governing Council (NGC) unanimously ratified recommendations by the party&rsquo;s National Disciplinary Committee that the said rebel members be axed from the party.The latest move puts former ODM Secretary General and Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba, Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Kwale Woman Representative Zainab Chidzuga, and MPs John Waluke (Sirisia) and Samuel Arama (Nakuru West) on the verge of losing their seats and consequently facing by-elections.Also to seek fresh mandates are MPs Isaac Mwaura, Steven Kariuki (Mathare), Masoud Mwahima (Likoni) and Viwandani Member of County Assembly Samuel Nyangwara.And tomorrow, MPs Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro (Kilifi North), Mustafa Iddi (Kilifi South), James Rege (Karachuonyo), Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East) and Chachu Ganya (North Horr) are expected to appear before the disciplinary committee chaired by Fred Athuok.But Mr Aburi has said he will not honour the summons once again, saying he was ready for a by-election.&mdash; Additional reports by Eric Abuga, Steve Mkawale and Grace Wekesa
