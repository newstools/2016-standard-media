The move by the United States to downgrade security threat in Kenya is welcome. It means that investors, especially Americans, can now set up base in the country. Though it might not be directly related, the country has made positive steps in enhancing security and combating terrorism. And these have paid off.&nbsp; This has boosted international confidence, as has been seen recently when Kenya moved a notch higher in reports such as the World Bank&rsquo;s &#39;Ease of Doing Business&#39; survey. The improvement was credited to reforms in starting business, registering property and protecting investors, among others. Kenya was also ranked as the world&rsquo;s third most reformed countries. All these point to a sustained effort to make the country attractive for investors. Over the past few months, the country has received high-profile visitors including US President Barack Obama and the Pope. A number of companies including Burger King and Ford have set up their bases in the country.&nbsp; As a country we are on the right track, but we should not rest on our laurels. We need to keep up with the series of reforms under the ease of doing business, infrastructure development and security.
