[Photo: Kelvin Karani/Standard]A university student suspected of having links with a terror group has been detained for 10 days. This is meant to allow police conclude their investigations into the suspect&#39;s alleged links to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).Hassan Kassim, an Information and Technology student at Moi University, was arrested on October 31, 2016 at Kizingo in Mombasa.According to police intelligence reports, Mr Kassim was scheduled to travel to Libya over the long holidays, though it is not clear on what mission.Thursday Principal Magistrate Francis Kiambia directed that he be detained at Port Police Station.On Wednesday, the magistrate said he would not be quick to grant police the 15 days they were requesting without them showing concrete reasons.Mr Kiambia said the reasons advanced by the police were not sufficient.&quot;I have said over and over again that I will not grant detention to police just because they file an affidavit requesting to detain a suspect,&quot; he said.&quot;The suspect will remain in police custody for 10 days which is sufficient enough to allow police (finish) their investigations.&quot;Kassim was accused of being in constant communication with ISIS members in Libya.Prosecutor Eugene Wangila said: &quot;I do believe the respondent who is a Kenyan of identity card 33317999 and a student at Moi University main campus Eldoret and currently on long holiday has contact with ISIS members and is scheduled to travel to Libya over the long holidays. We seek 15 days to conclude investigations.&quot;Mr Wangila said Kassim was being sought by ISIS members for his IT skills.However, in a sworn affidavit through his lawyer, Kassim said he was not involved in any terrorist group or any terror activities.Kassim said he was arrested at their house in Kizingo by people posing as police officers. The pre-trial hearing is scheduled for November 13.
