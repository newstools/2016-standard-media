&nbsp;Moi University Acting Vice Chancellor Laban Ayiro has said the institution is in a financial crisis. Prof Ayiro said the situation is dire and urgent action must be taken to&nbsp; salvage the institution. Ayiro, who assumed office two months ago, said the institution was unable to operate as expected as the management cannot make prudent financial and operational decisions. The VC cited inadequate and poorly maintained lecture halls and accommodation facilities, lack of voice projection equipment, inadequate teaching aids, laboratories, workshops and medical facilities. &quot;We have a paltry Sh143 million in our account, making the institution unable to realise any tangible infrastructure development. The quality of teaching, research and extension has lapsed to levels not expected of a national university of our standing,&quot; he noted. He added: &quot;The declining enrolment amidst increasing competition is symptomatic of the decaying infrastructure and quality standards.&quot; READ MORE Moi University to close two campuses From eating &lsquo;mukombero&rsquo; to hotel manager Moi University student detained over alleged ISIS links Prof Ayiro said health facilities are even turning away university staff seeking medical services. &quot;As a Chief Executive, I would never have imagined seeing hospitals reject Moi University patients; newspapers cannot pick our advertisements, suppliers only supply when our cheques have gone through and statutory deductions are in arrears, among others,&quot; he said.
