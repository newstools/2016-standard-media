Clan elders had a busy week as they hosted gubernatorial aspirants seeking their support ahead of the 2017 elections. Migori Governor Okoth Obado and one of his opponents, Ann Anyanga, have been criss-crossing the county seeking blessings and endorsement from clans that form crucial voting blocks in the region. Last month, the Abagusii community living in Migori endorsed Governor Obado&#39;s bid for a second term. The more than 200 representatives of the community who have been residing in the county for over three decades said they had agreed to support Obado. According to the Migori Abagusii community chairperson, Samuel Ogeto Anyona, there are over 60,000 Abagusii living in Migori and who are registered voters in the county. He said they supported the governor when he sought his maiden mandate in 2013 and were ready to support him again because he had united&nbsp; communities in the county.
