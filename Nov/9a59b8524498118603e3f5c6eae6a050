A 27-year-old man has committed suicide for fear that his expectant wife may miscarry. Antony Juma, whose wife had miscarried twice before, hanged himself using a rope inside his rental house at Rodi Kopany township in Homa Bay Sub-county on Sunday. The man&#39;s body was found dangling from the roof by his boss&#39;s wife when she went to call him to attend to some domestic chores. The former herder&#39;s younger brother Jared Juma said he had serious psychological issues based on past experiences of his wife losing their children. &quot;My brother was traumatised by the loss of his two children through miscarriages. He was withdrawn because he thought he might lose the third child too,&quot; said Jared. &quot;I asked him whether the boss was frustrating him but he told me &#39;no&#39;. I then involved friends for counselling to enable him believe that his wife can deliver successfully,&quot; he added.
