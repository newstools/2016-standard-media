When the government held State House Summit on land earlier this week, one of the key achievements touted was in the area of title deeds. The issuance of title deeds to be specific. While the processing of a few million deeds is a step in the right direction, it is a drop in the ocean when tens of millions other land owners - large and small - sit on land with little to show as proof of ownership.This is even more pronounced in counties away from major urban areas. Here, land, even in the middle of thriving urban centres, does not have title deeds. Those who buy and develop such pieces of land do so on the basis of hope and trust. Hope that if, and when, the government decides to issue them with title deeds, they will not be kicked out by well-connected individuals. This is not a strange occurrence after all. If land in the middle of Nairobi that has had a title deed for as long as anyone can remember can develop complications when a few other individuals turn up with genuine-looking documents, how so a piece of land where the only proof&nbsp; that it is yours is the word of village elders and poorly kept records at the defunct county councils?As has been said before in this space, these people who buy land on the strength of word of mouth and letters of allotment would rather have a system that works. But they cannot put their lives on hold while the government gets its act together.A few million titles deeds is a drop in the ocean when millions others live like squatters on property they own.
