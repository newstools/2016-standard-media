Two weeks ago, The Standard reported that Kenya&rsquo;s debts stood at a staggering Sh3.2 trillion.Make no mistake, Sh3.2 trillion is not a small amount of money. It is three times what KRA collects in a year.Though this is way beyond the limit allowed by the National Assembly that fixed the national debt ceiling at Sh2.5 trillion after the rebasing of the economy in 2014, we have been told that to grow, we have to borrow.And the economy is indeed growing and with it an expanded middle class.The appetite for luxury products is also growing; visit any shopping mall and witness the humanity in there, buying, eating, drinking...From the models of cars driven on our roads nowadays, it is clear conspicuous consumption has finally arrived. But is the cake big enough to go around?There are growing fears that the rise in the purchasing power of the middle class could be driven, not by hard work, but by graft.Does this probably explain why our national debt is also growing? Are we stealing from the money we borrowed?Because there seems to be a correlation between the increase in the middle class and the percentage by which wealth is being created by the middle class.During his recent visit, Tanzanian President John Magufuli repeatedly referred to giving opportunity to the poorer section of our society.Obviously, the socialist in him was suggesting that Kenya should adopt a levelling mechanism to increase participation by the lower strata of the society.He was challenging the status quo to do as he has done in Tanzania.Kenya probably represents the greatest irony of growth and development anywhere in the world.What we have in Kenya today, though hugely impressive, could be a bubble that will burst any time soon.We are seeing a boom in the construction and the real estate sector, yet the irony is that the purchase price of these property is way above the means of 95 per cent of the average population.What explains the fact that the purchase of property through mortgage is just a fraction of the total purchases of properties and houses.Or that most of the property being purchased, especially in high-end areas in Nairobi, Mombasa and other big towns are going for cash.A bungalow sitting on say 3-5 acres in Spring Valley or Kitusuru in Nairobi might cost hundreds of millions of shillings. Yet they are selling like hot cake.People are not taking mortgages to buy them because they are abnormally expensive and most people cannot pay through their salaries or honest income.Forget the story that it is because of the upgrade of the Nairobi UN office.No, not all convincing.The only explanation therefore is the accessibility of what is now euphemistically referred to as the &ldquo;new money&rdquo;. Money that has been acquired easily.An estate developer confided to me recently that a senior government official bought six units of his newly constructed estate and paid all in cash.Yes, all six in liquid cash.Now, it won&rsquo;t be difficult to connect the dots. The rise of the middle class has a direct link with the level of corruption in our public offices.The recent scandals at the Ministry of Devolution and many other departments (including Health) both at the county and national government show public officers are making wealth illegally at unprecedented rate.Sadly though, President Uhuru Kenyatta seems to have given up.Of course we give it to the President; a few senior Government officials have been sacked, probably after making hundreds of millions, and are now contemplating joining politics.Among the Somalis is a saying; a fox keeps going back to a place where it found some delicacy.That corruption might destroy this country is not in doubt at all. We even steal donor funds meant for the poor of the poor. President Magufuli&rsquo;s statement, if carefully analysed, suggests very politely what I am trying to say and what Julius Nyerere, his predecessor said; we are a man-eat-man society.Magufuli&rsquo;s speech gave a vivid and frightening picture of how a great state and nation like Kenya has been held back by those who constantly undermine the rule of law.Despite the fairly sophisticated system of law, Kenyans from all walks of life simply refuse to obey the law.The attitude of impunity is in all of us. It is not that those who have not looted are innocent as such. It is only that they never got their chance to eat.We therefore have developed a culture where stealing from the public is glorified. Where we ought to feel disgusted, we smile about it.Recently, somebody, referring to a former Cabinet Secretary who has since been sacked, said &ldquo;she ate like a man&rdquo;.Does that imply that inherently, every one of us, if given the chance, would dip our fingers into the cookie jar?
