Tharaka Nithi youths have gone furious on social media calling for authorities to sack a county official after he allegedly insulted a youth with his dead parents on twitter. The youths claim Igambang&#39;ombe sub-county administrator Mr Charles Nyaga has violated chapter six of the constitution that has spelt conduct of state officers. On his timeline, Mr Nyaga asked a constant critic of Governor Samuel Ragwa&#39;s administration, Mr Frank Mukembu, to direct his criticizing remarks to his dead parents. &quot;Frank Mukembu panda kwa kaburi ya your dead mother near your beautiful house and shout that mama yako asikie,&quot; he wrote. According to the constitution a state officer should behave, whether in public, official or private life or association with other persons in a manner that avoids conflict between personal interest and public or official interest. However, the constitution continues to state that an officer who contravenes the clauses should be dismissed and disqualified from holding any public office.
