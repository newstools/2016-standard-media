NAIROBI, KENYA: A Jubilee MP has trashed governors&#39; defence on corruption claims that the Integrated Finance Management Information System (Ifmis) is to blame for the mess in their counties.Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru said most of the 47 counties have been rocked by financial scandals because governors awarded tenders to their relatives, friends and cronies. &quot;They simply ignored every delivery aspect of good services,&quot; said Waweru.Waweru said the corrupt governors should not hide behind the IT system but instead come out and be held accountable.&quot;Kenyans had a lot of hopes on devolution, but most governors have proved to be just interested in enriching themselves,&quot; Waweru said.He added that all implicated county bosses should be sent home come 2017 and made to pay back the looted millions.Mr Waweru was reacting to the audit report released on Tuesday by the Auditor General Edward Ouko, that showed a huge chunk of the monies for the financial year 2014/15 was paid to ghost workers or fictitious companies.However, the governors led by their council chair Peter Munya immediately called for all counties to re-check their accounts with the Central Bank of Kenya arguing that Ifmis is to blame.The governors have called for an alternative system or have Ifmis shut down altogether.Waweru, who is also eyeing the Nairobi gubernatorial seat in next year&#39;s elections, on Wednesday asked the governors to account for every shilling sent to the counties.&quot;It is unacceptable for the county bosses to now turn around and blame a system that has been in use for years now,&quot; said Waweru questioning the payment of Sh134 million as legal fees to various law firms.
