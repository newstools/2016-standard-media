West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo was put under pressure to join Jubilee when President Uhuru Kenyatta visited the county on Wednesday.Jubilee leaders told the Kanu pointman that his party lost relevance a long time ago and he would be better off in the new party.Sigor MP Philip Rotino urged Lonyangapuo, who was recently installed as Pokot spokesman, to join the Government side, saying the region is now a Jubilee zone. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said Jubilee will accommodate him. But Lonyangapuo defended Kanu, saying the party is alive and ready for the 2017 polls.Uhuru&#39;s visit to the region came just weeks after his deputy William Ruto&#39;s.
