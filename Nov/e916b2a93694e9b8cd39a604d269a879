A confrontation is looming between local politicians and chiefs in the region following orders to arrest leaders who cause chaos at public meetings. Nyanza Regional Co-ordinator Wilson Njega directed chiefs to help arrest any politicians found disrupting public gatherings. Mr Njega told the chiefs it was their duty to ensure that hate-mongers in their locations were arrested and prosecuted, regardless of their standing in society. Addressing chiefs at the county headquarters where he was hosted by County Commissioner Kassim Farrah, Njega urged the administrators to ensure that Nyanza was peaceful during and after the 2017 elections. He said many cases of violence had been caused by politicians who wanted to attack or discredit their rivals in public. &quot;We need to keep vigil in our villages to ensure that nobody disrupts the peace ahead of the next General Election,&quot; said Njega.
