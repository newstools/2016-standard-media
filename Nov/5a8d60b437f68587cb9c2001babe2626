The emboldened suppliers&rsquo; power, creeping from intimidation and growing frustrations could be felt last month. This is when Trade Principal Secretary Chris Kiptoo engineered an uneasy truce between suppliers, manufacturers and retailers.The cogs that give you easy access to leisure and everyday necessities for a comfortable life have been pulling apart over the issue of when suppliers get paid. And this backroom war is threatening the survival of the local supermarket labels in the country.Suppliers claim they are owed over Sh40 billion by retailers, with troubled Uchumi shouldering the least of the burden at Sh3.6 billion. The other three major retailers, Nakumatt, Tuskys and Naivas, could be holding more. The three owed Sh8 billion to suppliers as per a protest letter two years ago, a figure that could have gone up substantially.That suppliers may no longer be willing to suffer in the cold is showing through the embarrassing empty shelves in supermarkets.On that Wednesday morning of October 5, when PS Kiptoo brought the stakeholders in one tense room bursting with tension and frustrations, he asked the parties to be frank to find a solution. Nakumatt went first.Very low margins&ldquo;There are multiple challenges affecting businesses, which are different for everyone, in our case we are going through cash flow issues and this is being passed on to suppliers. Some of the outlets like Westgate are out of our control. Retailers are not demons, we need you as partners,&rdquo; Nakumatt Holdings, Business Development Lead, Neel Shah said then.A month later, photos of empty shelves at some of Nakumatt outlets in Uganda went viral on social media, forcing the retailer to admit liquidity issue and make an offer for 25 per cent stake to an unknown international investor.The potential entry of a strategic investor in Nakumatt has been on the cards over the years, but never have the owners been so willing to open up control to outsiders.It also took empty shelves to raise the red flag at Uchumi after suppliers stopped supplying products and demanded to be paid. This would reveal the intricate fraud at the firm and momentous supplier debt that had been allowed to coalesce for years.Supplier power is growing as they come together and lobby government, push retailers and in the case of Uchumi force the supermarket into a profitless scheme where they get paid immediately through an escrow account they control.Nakumatt announced that they are actively engaging suppliers to review their terms. It is, however, not clear whether the current arrangement where they are supposed to pay suppliers after 90 days will be reviewed. Most retailers have been abusing these terms by paying them after 180-270 days.But are retailers to blame? Suppliers claim this animosity has been fuelled by high handedness of retailers who do not pay yet they continue expanding their reach. On their part, retailers blame a tough operating environment, very low margins and a strained balance sheet that has sunk most of the retailers to the red.Analysts opine that while each of the companies have their own story, funding expansion and the health of the economy seem to echo through the whole sector. Bigger may not be better for local retailers anymore as leading supermarket chains stare at losses from high overhead costs.Nakumatt and Ukwala have all reported losses this year, while Uchumi will defer making public its misfortunes; each at different stages of an expansion plan funded by loans and shareholder cash.Uchumi, Kenya&rsquo;s oldest retailer, which was planning a regional expansion when it fell flat last year has found itself in trouble twice from dreaming big and trying to establish a regional presence across East Africa opening several branches. It was forced to close them down at a loss.Nakumatt, which saw this as more of an opportunity than a lesson, walked right into the same path with 63 regional outlets, six in Tanzania, four in Rwanda and 10 in Uganda now wants to sell half its stake in Tanzania. Choppies, which is expanding into Zambia and Kenya bought out Ukwala and has already sunk into loss making territory and does not see breaking even soon as the company throws in additional funds at expansion.The Botswana retailer said in its financial statements that operations in the two countries will remain loss making in 2017 as they continue to build their store base and invest in operational infrastructure. &ldquo;The issue could be the working capital management and the rent escalation on some of the malls where they have new branches,&rdquo; Eric Munywoki of Sterling Capital said.Mr Munywoki said when a retailer is expanding without waiting for the branches to break-even and continues opening more outlets it can be pushed into a cash flow problem that has a negative impact on performance.&ldquo;What tends to happen is that operating costs go up, and could even go higher than operating revenue,&rdquo; he said.Also, the entry of new players into an already competitive market, currently under the grip of Nakumatt, Tuskys, Naivas and Uchumi may have fostered the blinding ambition to grow presence across the region.The place to investMunywoki said it was only normal for the retailers to try and defend their market share given this is a game of volumes.Then there is the demographic dividend. Kenya&rsquo;s population is expected to reach 46.6 million this year if projections that the country has been growing by 3,388 persons daily is anything to go by.The country&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product is projected to increase by 5.9 per cent from $55 billion (Sh5.59 trillion) in 2013 to $63 billion (Sh6.4 trillion) raising income per person from Sh80,000 to Sh140,000 in five years.To a retailer, these are two important considerations. More customers with deeper pockets, and an assurance to their owners and financiers to go big into a country&rsquo;s market.Kenya has also been touted as the place to invest in with the Financial Times placing Kenya above Nigeria as the &lsquo;retail crown of the continent&rsquo;. While only 5 per cent of Nigeria&rsquo;s retail sector consists of formal shopping, in Kenya supermarkets and malls account for about 30 per cent.But are Kenyans really getting wealthier? The World Bank&rsquo;s recent report, Beyond Resilience, points out that the factors underpinning Kenya&rsquo;s economic growth are a vibrant services sector, robust construction industry, low inflation, currency stability and low fuel prices.This growth has not trickled to the manufacturing and agricultural sector which account for almost 80 per cent of the jobs in the country meaning very few Kenyans have extra change to spare.World Bank says that Kenya has a skewed economic growth noting that between 2006 and 2014, 72 per cent of the increase in GDP was coming from the services, financial sectors and mobile communications.&ldquo;Kenya has an investments led growth whose problems is that the sectors that create jobs are not necessarily growing if you look at agriculture and manufacturing,&rdquo; Mr Jibran Qureishi, regional economist at Stanbic Bank said.Mr Qureishi said until the huge infrastructure projects that are holding up the headline numbers start paying dividends there will be a disparity between nominal and real economy where people do not have jobs and thus cannot spend.The problem has also been heightened by a tight operating environment that has seen companies sack employees to cut costs while the Government has frozen employment.copy and paste strategy&ldquo;We have seen reduced footfall in many old and newly constructed shopping malls and convenient stores. Spending power especially in the urban space is usually fickle and can be affected by factors such as perception, also it is generally thought that the installation of new and tough &lsquo;Know Your Customer&rsquo; rules for banks has translated to a reduction of the flow of money in the grey and informal economy hence severely diminishing the spending power of a large number of usually very financially liquid Kenyans,&rdquo; Uchumi boss Julius Kipng&rsquo;etich said.Some of the retailers on their part have not dampened their spirits. Naivas Supermarket, which bought out Rihab Supermarket in Nakuru for Sh70 million says it has set aside an additional Sh400 million to buy stores in Thika, Kericho and Nairobi&rsquo;s Utawala, Kiambu Road, Kawangware and Mountain View.Tuskys Chief Executive Officer Daniel Githua says the problem is not a poorer-limited-market but a copy and paste strategy that has lumped retailers to similar nodes resulting in cannibalisation.Cannibalisation is when there&rsquo;s a reduction in sales volume, sales revenue, or market share of one brand as a result of the introduction of similar brands.&ldquo;The issue is more of disparity in concentration of retailers. For example, Eldoret is a town that can be optimally served by 6 or 7 retailers, but now we have more than 15. With that kind of concentration, some stores will be unsustainable,&rdquo; Mr Githua told Business Beat.&ldquo;On the other hand, we have towns or areas that are underserved, for example Kawangware. I would say retailers have over-invested in some areas, and what we shall see next is a natural correction.&rdquo;Kingdom Securities equity trader Ronald Lugalia thinks that this space is already taken by smaller chains and general stores that have grown significantly away from city and town centres.&ldquo;The smaller guys at the estates have really grown and are giving guys likes of Tuskys and Nakumatt who opened up branches there a lot of competition,&rdquo; he said.In an opinion piece, former Editor of Mail &amp; Guardian Africa Charles Obbo also questioned Nakumatt&rsquo;s strategy to go into areas captured by the smaller retailers.&ldquo;The rise of new suburbs in Kampala, don&rsquo;t necessarily mean the growth of a market. Instead of a large supermarket, something the size of the mini-markets attached to petrol stations might have been enough, who knows?&rdquo; Mr Obbo wrote in Uganda&rsquo;s Daily Monitor.Mr Githua does not agree that their market share of fast moving consumer goods cannot be wrested from the arms of that small pick-market, a stone throw away that sells milk, bread and margarine spread.online shopping&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see mini markets as competition, they are complimentary. There are products you can&rsquo;t sell in a supermarket and therefore mini markets and mama mbogas become handy. We get more business where we are surrounded by mama mboga than locations where we are alone,&rdquo; the Tuskys boss said.Uchumi says it has found a way round the competition announcing that it plans on partnering with existing mini markets and estate franchises in a win-win partnership.&ldquo;The Uchumi brand look and feel will increase the partners&rsquo; footfall and lead more sales as Uchumi benefits from franchise fee for the brand and a percentage of the sales as commission,&rdquo; Mr Kipng&rsquo;etich said.Supermarkets have also come face to face with growing online shopping which has burst Rupu, Jumia, OLX and Kilimall onto the race for customers. Online retailers offer convenience in terms of delivery, payment options and pass on warranties and have less operating costs making them even more competitive.And the younger generation, unlike their seniors are less likely to respond to calls for brand patriotism which denied most of the South African companies a piece of the Kenyan consumer given they are more exposed to global brands.Mr Munywoki, however, thinks the local brands are too aggressive to be edged out by the new entrants who expect their retail stores to operate at the optimal levels they experience back home, something that is rarely the case.However, low sales volumes and a tough operating environment did not affect Kenya only. Choppies also made losses in South Africa and Zimbabwe and faced a challenging environment in Botswana where it reported a percentage increase in profitability.According to a research by Nielsen Holdings, a global performance management company, tough economic times are eroding consumer spending and retail confidence in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa.On average, only a quarter of traders polled in nine countries&mdash;South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire and Cameroon&mdash;were confident that spending in their outlets was rising.In Kenya, 24 per cent of retailers feel customers are buying more from their stores down from over 30 at the beginning of last year.
