The Education ministry and the office of the Ombudsman have differed sharply over plans to re-locate the Kenya Technical Trainers College (KTTC). Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i had instructed University of Nairobi to make available its Kenya Science Campus (KSC) along Ngong road for occupation by the KTTC. In his letter to Idle Farah, the University Council chairperson, Matiang&#39;i said the Government had reached a &#39;strategic decision&#39; to relocate KTTC from its current premises in Gigiri with effect from December 1. &quot;Your council is required to surrender the premises and all the facilities within it to the council of KTTC with effect from, December 1, 2016,&quot; reads the letter dated September 9. But the office of the Ombudsman has questioned why KTTC should be moved to a science institute when there are many technical colleges that can absorb the students. The Ombudsman argues that closure of Kenya Science, which trains graduate science teachers, will have far-reaching consequences on shortage of science and mathematics teachers.

In a report released last week, the Ombudsman further observed that there has been heavy investment in both institutions by donor partners as well as successive governments. The Ombudsman questions whether all relevant stakeholders were consulted on the planned transfer and whether legal processes of acquisition of land were followed. But Matiang&#39;i said the decision to relocate the college is within his ministry&#39;s mandate and accused the Ombudsman of prejudice.
