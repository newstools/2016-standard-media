A secondary school principal in Murang&#39;a County has been interdicted after he arrived late at an examination collection centre. Githanga Secondary School Principal Charles Mwangi had failed to collect the KCSE examination papers from&nbsp;Murang&#39;a East Sub-county container on time on Thursday morning. Reports indicate that when Mwangi arrived at the container, he found that Murang&#39;a East education officer Richard Ng&#39;ang&#39;a had delivered examination papers to his school. Yesterday, Murang&#39;a County director of education Lawrence Kirimi said Mwangi had been suspended and his deputy appointed to take charge. &quot;There is a directive indicating that principals must personally collect examination materials from the container. He reported at 7am, which amounts to misconduct,&quot; said Kirimi. Earlier, Mwangi was locked up at Murang&#39;a police station before he was released in the evening and handed over to education officers.
