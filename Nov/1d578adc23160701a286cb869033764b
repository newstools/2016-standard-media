Mama Sarah Obama, the grandmother of out-going US President Barack Obama, congratulated Donald Trump on his victory as the 45th President of the US. &quot;I want to urge him to work well like my grandson did. He should work hard to keep Americans united,&quot; Mama Sarah told a group of journalists who visited her home yesterday morning. She said she had no hard feelings because President Barack Obama&#39;s tenure had come to an end. &quot;We expect the new President to preach peace to the world,&quot; she said Mama Sarah also urged President Obama visit her now that he was going to be a civilian. &quot;He should come and visit us as a private American citizen,&quot; she said.
