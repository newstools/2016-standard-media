ODM MPs now want the Office of the Deputy President investigated over the National Youth Service (NYS) scandal.The legislators said DP William Ruto&#39;s office must be probed in connection with the theft of Sh791 million.The Deputy President has adversely mentioned former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru. ODM chairman John Mbadi yesterday claimed that someone in Ruto&#39;s office was involved in the scandal, citing the recent public squabbling between the DP and Ms Waiguru, as well as the link made by the former CS of two key Ruto allies to the illegal cash payments.&quot;Ruto has been quiet before Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Farouk Kibet were adversely mentioned in the scandal. But he began getting annoyed after the two were mentioned hence his office should be investigated,&quot; argued Mr Mbadi. Testifying before the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee last week, Waiguru named Mr Kibet, the Deputy President&#39;s assistant, among operatives she claimed were constantly on phone with prime suspect Ben Gethi, in the days before the theft was executed.She also questioned payments labelled &quot;legal fees&quot; made to Mr Murkomen from firms linked to Gethi.Mbadi asked committee chairman Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda MP) to ensure the DP&#39;s office was thoroughly investigated.&quot;This scandal is bigger than Waiguru alone and anybody who demonstrates suspicion should be investigated effectively because it is evident that Kenyans lost an extremely large amount of money in the NYS scandal,&quot; he added.Addressing the Press, MPs Mbadi, Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), Oburu Oginga (nominated), TJ Kajwang (Ruaraka), Peter Kaluma (Homa Bay) and Timothy Bosire (Kitutu Masaba) challenged Ruto and Waiguru to lay bare everything they knew about the scandal.&quot;We demand accountability. It is now in the public domain that an aide to Deputy President William Ruto, Farouk Kibet, received money from the proceeds of the NYS scandal. Can Ruto tell us what he personally knows about the matter? Could this be the reason why he is of late disparaging Anne Waiguru, another principal suspect?&quot; the party asked.The ODM party also gave Kibet, Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri and Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia one week to step aside for investigations into their alleged involvement in corruption.They pointed out that while Kibet was mentioned by Waiguru in connection with the NYS scandal, Dr Muraguri and Mr Macharia, who previously served as the Health CS, should be held responsible for the Sh5 billion Ministry of Health scam.
