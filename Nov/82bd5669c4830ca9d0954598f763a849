Donald Trump has won the US elections. In a shocking twist of events, Trump went on to clinch the victory, winning 276 of the college votes compared to Hillary Clinton&#39;s 218.&nbsp;On a phonecall to Trump, Hillary has conceded defeat, opting to address the outcome at daybreak. Donald was quick to apppreciate Clinton&#39;s gesture and intimated that she had run a good race.Republican Donald Trump stunned the world on Tuesday by defeating heavily favored Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House, ending eight years of Democratic rule and sending the United States on a new, uncertain path. A wealthy real-estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to defeat Clinton, whose gold-plated establishment resume includes stints as a first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state.Worried a Trump victory could cause economic and global uncertainty, investors were in full flight from risky assets such as stocks. In overnight trading, S&amp;P 500 index futures fell 5 percent to hit their so-called limit down levels, indicating they would not be permitted to trade any lower until regular U.S. stock market hours on Wednesday.The Associated Press and Fox News projected that Trump had collected just enough of the 270 state-by-state electoral votes needed to win a four-year term that starts on Jan. 20, taking battleground states where presidential elections are traditionally decided.In his acceptance speech, he said his government would work towards national growth and renewal, with an economic plan pointing towards&nbsp;double growth and&nbsp;making America the strongest economy in the world.Trump assured&nbsp;great relations with countries willing to work with America and&nbsp;promised a world of opportunities for America&#39;s forgotten.&nbsp;To the world community, he said that though he would put America first, he would&nbsp;deal fairly with everyone, and&nbsp;seek common ground&nbsp;not hostility with the rest of the world.&nbsp;Trump also thanked&nbsp;a host of people including his&nbsp;late parents, sisters, brother Robert, late brother Fred, Melania&nbsp;and his former former wives, children and his &nbsp;campaign team. He paid special tribute to all his competitors and said he would be willing to work with them towards making America great again.&nbsp;He recognised the fact that though campaigns had ended, his work for America had just began, and promised that his team would hit the ground running.
