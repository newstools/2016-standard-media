Ford Kenya has initiated disciplinary action against its errand members who had publicly declared their support for Jubilee, joining Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) partners in an onslaught against rebels.CORD co-principal Moses Wetang&#39;ula&#39;s party has constituted a disciplinary committee to investigate conduct of some of its members deemed to be have joined Jubilee Party, with an aim of expelling them from the party.Addressing a press conference in Nairobi after the party&#39;s management committee meeting, deputy party leader and Kakamega Senator Boni Khalalwe, Secretary General Eseli Simiyu and Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said the party intends to expel the rebels for going against the party constitution. The party targets to expunge its former chairman and Turkana Senator John Munyes, MPs Nicholas Ngikor (Turkana East) and Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga).Mr Munyes was on Friday picked by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy William Ruto as part of his re-election campaign team and has declared he would run on a Jubilee ticket.Khalwale said they had narrowed on the three because of what the party termed as a continued defiance against the outfit that handed them victory in 2013 general election.&quot;We have resolved that we create a disciplinary committee that should look into the conduct of some of our members that has been contrary to the constitution of Ford Kenya,&quot; said Khalwale.Tongaren MP Eseli Simuyu said the committee to be chaired by Justice Richard Kuloba is set issue a seven-day notice to the members to appear before it.Ford Kenya indicated that it would fast tract the process owing to the limited time left for by-elections to be conducted ahead of the August 8, 2017 polls.The party said the committee&#39;s report would be ready for adoption by its National Executive Council (NEC) set to meet at a retreat set to take place on November 24 and 25.ODM has since expelled ten of its rebel members and written to the Registrar of Political Parties, electoral commission and speakers of affected house to declare their seats vacant for by-elections.But the process of delisting the targeted leaders has since been put on hold following an appeal by the leaders, who include a governor, deputy governor, seven MPs and an MCA.Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s Wiper has since written show cause letters to Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, and MPs John Munuve (Mwingi North), Joe Mutambo (Mwingi Central), Katemi Makenga (Kaiti), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni) and Robert Mutemi (nominated) to explain why they should not be removed from the party&#39;s membership list.The Opposition coalition has vowed to punish its members who have refused to toe the party line, claiming scheme by the ruling Jubilee coalition to &quot;buy out&quot; some of its members to weaken it.
