Nine women have been arrested for engaging in Female Genital Mutilation related practices in Tuyoitich village, Nakuru County. Among those arrested were six women aged between 22 and 27 years who had undergone the cut while the others appeared to be engaged in the cut and helped the girls in healing. Njoro police boss Philip Opiyo said the women were found locked inside a house after undergoing the illegal &lsquo;cut&rsquo; last Friday. Mr Opiyo said officers raided the house following a tip off on Saturday. During the early morning arrest, the victims were found asleep while those taking care of them were preparing meals. One suspect went into hiding but the officers intensified search and caught up with her. &ldquo;We received a report from a local administrator that a section of women had been locked in a house after undergoing the cut. Officers stormed the house and arrested them together with those who were aiding in the practice,&rdquo; said Opiyo. The officer said more investigations are underway to bring to book more women who are engaged in the act. Tuyoitich location chief Wycliffe Ruto said he received information about the women through the Nyumba Kumi initiative. Ruto said after confirming the reports, he involved officers who raided the house the women were hiding in and arrested them.
