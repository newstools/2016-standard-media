Meru University of Science and Technology (MUST) has acquired more than 700 acres in a massive expansion plan. Vice Chancellor Japhet Magambo said the university had grown rapidly since retired President Mwai Kibaki presented it with a charter in 2010. Prof Magambo cited the institution&rsquo;s innovation centre, saying it had become a source of new technologies, including a mobile phone application to remotely monitor and control the environment inside greenhouses. &ldquo;The innovation centre was a Sh100 million gift to the university from the chancellor, James Mwangi, to develop the youth&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and competencies in all areas,&rdquo; said Magambo of the donation from the Equity Bank CEO. He said the centre is in the forefront in nurturing industrial, technological and scientific innovations.
