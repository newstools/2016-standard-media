The devolution torch has sparked mixed reactions in Western and North Rift counties. The caravan scheduled to make rounds across the 47 counties has been moving across Kakamega and Trans Nzoia counties in the past five days to receive public views. But while most of those interviewed expressed gratitude for the new system of governance which they cited to have positively transformed their lives, a majority cited a few challenges they noted to be derailing the ultimate goal of devolution. &quot;I am indebted to the initiators of this system for the numerous services I used to seek in far flung areas are now accessible at my doorstep such as health,&quot; said Gabriel Omukule, a resident of Saboti. Among the county governments initiated projects that residents lauded in the two counties included improved health services, availability of farm inputs and agricultural machinery for hire at subsidised rates, establishment of comfortable early childhood development centres and access to bursaries for scholars.
