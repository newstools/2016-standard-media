Kampala: It was early in the morning when Jackson Mukasa was awakened by the chants outside his Kampala home. &quot;The homos are in there!&quot; the crowd yelled, banging spoons on metal cooking pots. Mukasa, a 21-year-old gay man living in the Ugandan capital, was terrified. &quot;We opened the door, and there were police and people everywhere. The local councilman was there, yelling &#39;Out with the homos! You are scaring people in the area.&#39; I still have scars from the beatings that followed,&quot; Mukasa said. It was January 2014. After being beaten by the mob, the police took Mukasa and a male friend staying with him in for questioning, he said. They were both subjected to forced anal examinations, said Mukasa.
