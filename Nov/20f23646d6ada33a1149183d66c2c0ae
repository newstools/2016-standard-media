Social media networking company Facebook plans to deepen the use of its platform in Kenya by individuals and businesses.This is meant to increase its advertising revenues through a local office for which the firm is scouting for a suitable candidate.This comes barely two months after the visit of Facebook Chief Executive and Founder Mark Zuckerberg to Kenya. In an advert doing rounds on the Internet, the company said it is looking for a growth manager for Kenya who will help increase the use of the social media platform in the country.The successful candidate will particularly help grow subscriber numbers as well as recruit more companies to advertise on Facebook.&quot;The ideal candidate will have experience in the consumer Internet and mobile space. As a growth manager for Kenya, you will lead Facebook to its full potential in the local market,&quot; says the firm in the advert.&quot;With a deep understanding of the local competitive and product landscape, you will determine product gaps, identify growth opportunities, drive execution of growth initiatives and add value to the Facebook user experience.&quot;Facebook has an estimated 5.5 million users in Kenya, which is a fairly low level of usage, considering the number of people with Internet access as well as the level of penetration in the country.According to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), there is an estimated 37.4 million Internet users in the country, which translates to a penetration of 87.2 per cent.The process of recruiting a new executive to steer the company &#39;s growth in Kenya comes after Zuckerberg&#39;s visit in September, where he said he had come to learn about the mobile money ecosystem in the country.&quot;The reason I specifically wanted to come to Nairobi is the fact that Kenya is a clear leader in mobile money,&quot; he said the visit.&quot;It has been very fascinating to see how you can move money so efficiently in a way you can&#39;t in many other countries, including the US, and I have come to see how the system works, what is possible and how people are thinking about it.&quot;Facebook had a revenue of $17.93 billion in 2015. Over 97 per cent of the firm&#39;s revenue comes from advertising.
