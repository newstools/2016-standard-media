A new 300-store shopping mall has opened its doors in Nairobi&rsquo;s Eastleigh today as demand for business space continues to surge.The multi-million shilling storied shopping mall, dubbed Yare Business Park, has increased the floor space for business in the area and consolidates Eastleigh as a growing business hub in Kenya and the region.&nbsp;This is the 50th mall to be built in Eastleigh with more currently under construction, making the area a magnet for a variety of businesses in clothes, electronics and other household commodities. The mall&rsquo;s owner Ahmed Abdullahi Yare indicated that the mall is meant to meet the huge demand for business space which has far outstripped the supply in the area.&ldquo;We will continue investing in shopping malls since we are driven by demand. This will help more people find secure places for their businesses,&rdquo; he said.On his part, Eastleigh Business Community Chair Ibrahim Hussein called on the government to put in place an enabling environment to attract local and foreign investors in order to boost the economy and create wealth and jobs.&ldquo;Currently, investments worth more than Sh120 billion have been made in Eastleigh. The investments should be protected and nurtured,&rdquo; he said.He added, &ldquo;The government should ignore local investors. We also have a big role to play in boosting the economy.&rdquo;He called on the government to resolve the current standoff involving hawkers in Eastleigh who want to forcefully return and sell their wares in front of shopping malls.This has led to running battles between hawkers and police almost daily thereby scaring away potential customers.&nbsp;&ldquo;We conduct legitimate businesses, pay taxes and create jobs. The government should ensure there is security and good infrastructure to stimulate growth of Eastleigh further as a business hub,&rdquo; he said.He called on merchants in Eastleigh to uphold integrity in carrying out their businesses without breaking the laws of the country.Somali Envoy to Kenya Jamal Hassan called on the business community in Eastleigh to work closely with the authorities to avoid incidences of insecurity which has far reaching implications on the economy.The new shopping mall has a number of facilities including a conference hall capable of carrying 1800 persons at one go.
