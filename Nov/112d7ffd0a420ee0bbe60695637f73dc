At least 1,000 people in Ganze and Bamba will benefit from a cash transfer programme to cushion them against the vagaries of hunger. Each household will get Sh6,000 via M-Pesa starting this week to help them meet their basic needs, with a special focus on nutrition. Most people in the county, and indeed many parts of the country, are facing starvation due to the prevailing drought that has destroyed crops and led to an acute shortage of water as rivers dry up. The four-month prgramme comes courtesy of the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS),&nbsp;the Finnish Red Cross (FRC) and the British Red Cross (BRC). The KRCS Coast Regional Manager, Hassan Musa, said they had already identified beneficiaries. &quot;We are targeting poor households in the programme that runs until January next year, with a view to improving their diet,&quot; Mr Musa said, adding that the region was facing an acute shortage of food and water after the rains failed.

He said they were also working with the Department of Health to provide information on how to improve hygiene and nutrition. &quot;This is supposed to complement the cash transfer programme so that residents can have a balanced diet,&quot; the official said. This will be followed by monitoring to ensure that all targeted beneficiaries receive the money. The drought has also affected pastoralists as livestock die due to lack of pasture and water in many parts of the country. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
