A woman was left with more than a foot and a half of loose skin that resembled a &#39;melting candle&#39; after losing 16 stone.Celia Shroder, 32, had been viciously bullied since childhood for her weight and ridiculed for wearing adult clothes when she was just 11.The mum-of-four, who weighed 27 stone at her heaviest, decided to turn her life around after fearing her children would also be tormented for having an overweight parent. Five years ago Celia, from Colorado, U.S., underwent gastric bypass surgery and lost a staggering 16 stone but was devastated she was left with masses of sagging skin, which she said looked like a &#39;melting candle&#39;.Three months ago, the full-time mum had surgery to remove the flab and now a svelte 11st 4lbs, says she is happy with her body for the first time in her life.Celia said: &quot;My excess skin looked like a melted candle, it was as if the skin was dripping down my body.&quot;I wanted to feel good about how much weight I&#39;d lost, but because of the skin I hated how I looked.&quot;It was so bad that I had to buy clothing two sizes bigger so that I could fit all of my excess skin in.&quot;The extra skin caused problem for me when exercising, I had constant infections and rashes, it all made me feel miserable.&quot;Before I used to have to skin folds hanging from my stomach, but now that it has been reduced I feel a lot happier.&quot;My self-perception is much better. It&#39;s helped my confidence and now I finally feel comfortable in my own body.&quot;Now when I look at myself in the mirror I like what I see for the first time in my life.&quot;Before I would avoid mirrors at all costs, I&#39;d never like to look at myself, now I&#39;m the opposite and feel great.&quot;Celia attributes her weight gain to emotional eating during her younger years, coupled with constant bullying.She added: &quot;I&#39;ve been overweight my entire life, I started wearing clothing meant for women before I was in my teens and it only got worse when I hit adulthood.&quot;I was bullied for my weight all throughout my school days, there was a lot of name calling.&quot;One of my saddest moments was when I was cycling on my bike in 8th grade, some kids sailed past in a car and yelled &#39;fat ass&#39; at me from the window.&quot;Because of that I didn&#39;t feel I could ride my bike anymore and deliberately left it unlocked outside so that it would be stolen.&quot;Then in adulthood, people would look at me in disgust when I was out in public.&quot;Once at a fast food restaurant, the server asked me if I had &#39;finished ordering the whole menu,&#39; which was horrible.&quot;Celia tried numerous diets in the past including low carb, Atkins, Slim Fast as well as exercise DVDs and diet supplements but nothing worked.In 2011, still haunted by the memories of being bullied at school, she decided to have a weight loss surgery so that her daughter wouldn&#39;t be victimised for having an obese mum.Celia said: &quot;The fear that one day my little girl could come home from school crying because some bully told her that she had a &#39;fat mom&#39; killed me inside and prompted me to take action.&quot;Since having the surgery, my perception of food has been completely different.&quot;Cheesecake was my favourite dessert but now I can&#39;t eat it, even fast food like McDonalds and Burger King taste bad to me.&quot;After losing more than half her body weight, Celia struggled with confidence issues because of her excess skin.She went under the knife for a second time in September and now is finally proud of her 16-stone weight loss.Celia added: &quot;I look so different now that people don&#39;t recognise me anymore, they&#39;re shocked at how much I&#39;ve transformed.&quot;It feels surreal, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve thought about my entire life and now it&#39;s a reality.&quot;DIET BEFOREBreakfast - three bowls of chocolate coated cereal with milkSnacks - candy, cake and cookiesLunch - am, turkey and cheese sandwiches and crispsDinner - super-sized McDonald&#39;s double quarter-pounder meal with cokeDessert - cheesecake or crispsDIET AFTERBreakfast - protein shake and toastLunch - cheese and deli meat with crackersDinner - grilled chicken, broccoli and green beans
