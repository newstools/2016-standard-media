&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} Berlin: German police launched dawn raids on mosques, apartments and offices in ten German states on Tuesday, and the government banned a group it accused of trying to recruit fighters for Islamic State, the interior ministry said. A spokeswoman for the ministry described the DWR &#39;True Religion&#39; organization as a mobilizing network for Islamic State, though she said there was no indication it was planning attacks itself. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere believed the group breached Germany&#39;s constitution and incited hatred, she added. He was due to make a statement on the arrests and the ban later on Tuesday. There was no immediate statement from the group.
