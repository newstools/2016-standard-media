Mandera County leaders want the Interior ministry to end the 12-hour curfew put in force on October 25. The curfew followed an attack at a lodge in Mandera Town. The dusk-to-dawn curfew has been criticised by residents who say it affects their businesses and religion. Elected officials now want Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery to review the two-month curfew. Governor Ali Roba said while the curfew was a deterrent to would-be terrorists, it inconvenienced businesses and worshippers. &quot;Businesses have to close as early as 4pm to beat the curfew hours, which is extremely detrimental to the socio-economic well being of the population,&quot; Mr Roba said. Residents also said the curfew blocked them from attending evening and early morning prayers, which fall within the prohibited hours.
