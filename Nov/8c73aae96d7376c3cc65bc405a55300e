Turkana County Governor Josephat Nanok has critcised Deputy President William Ruto over remarks about the local leadership during a recent visit to the area.In an unsigned advertisers&rsquo; announcement, the county leadership took issue with statements it claims were made by the DP during the launch of the Kitale-Lokichar road, which it termed as &lsquo;unfortunate, misleading and unbecoming&rsquo;. Ruto was on a tour of Turkana County this week where he questioned use of county funds. But in a hard-hitting statement, Nanok (pictured) questioned the DP&rsquo;s motive, citing presentations the county recently made at State House where it outlined the gains of devolution. &ldquo;When the county made a presentation at State House on October&nbsp;6 and on other occasions about the gains of devolution and early oil (sic), wasn&rsquo;t Ruto aware? Doesn&rsquo;t the DP see what others are seeing in terms of development in Turkana County?&rdquo;The statement accuses the DP of &lsquo;sneaking&rsquo; into the county without the knowledge of county officials. He questioned whether the statements made by the DP pointed to his lack of confidence in organs that oversee the use of county funds like Parliament, the Senate and national audit office, and reiterated the need to use proper channels in addressing such concerns. The statement points out that Turkana County and its people respect the Presidency and would expect that the same courtesy to be extended to them. It took issue with statements it said could incite local people.
