Night watchmen thwarted an attempt by a group of schoolboys to raid a girls&#39; school.Nine Form Four students from Onjiko Boys&#39; High School in Kisumu County were arrested after their mission to sneak into a girls&#39; school at night failed. The students had trekked some 10km from their school to Ahero Girls Secondary school on Wednesday night but were repulsed by the school&#39;s security.After the failed mission, they broke into shops at the Ahero township but were accosted by the public before the police intervened and arrested them.Nyando acting OCPD Gathoni Mungaro confirmed the arrest of the boys but denied claims they had stolen property from the market.As it later turned out, the boys were attempting to sneak into the girls&#39; school for what is believed to have been a planned sexual escapade.&quot;We have since established the boys and girls had been in constant communication by use of mobile phones, this is how they planned the night meeting,&quot; said Mungaro.The police have since confiscated mobile phones from both the boys and the girls involved which they had been using to communicate all along.Mungaro said the police will interrogate the girls involved as well; and that both schools will be closely monitored during the KCSE examination period.&quot;When such things happen, a lot of rumours move around. There have been claims that the boys had gone to the girls to share with them leaked examinations. That is why we have taken our time to interrogate them and record their statements,&quot; she said.
