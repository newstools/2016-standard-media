The Government has built a police post in Songhor West along the clash-prone Kisumu-Nandi border.The establishment of the police post follows an outcry from residents regarding frequent clashes between communities living along the border.The conflicts in Muhoroni, Songhor, Miwani, Chemelil and Nandi-Kipsigis has been a sore point for years, with fresh attacks emerging during election periods. A few months ago, more than three people were killed and hundreds injured amid reports that raiders who had torched houses faced little resistance because the police were caught flat-footed.The protests forced security bosses to deploy more than 400 police officers to the region to patrol the border and help quell the violence. Over 500 families were displaced as a result of the skirmishes.During musician Achieng Abura&#39;s funeral , Nyando MP Fred Outa and Kisumu Woman Rep Rose Nyamunga called for peaceful co-existence among the two communities.
