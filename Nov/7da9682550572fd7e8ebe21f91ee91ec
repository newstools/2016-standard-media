Business people planning to construct along the Sagana-Makutano Tourist circuit will have to comply with stringent building standards. Kirinyaga Governor Joseph Ndathi said he has instructed his Physical Planning Department to be strict while approving building plans meant for businesses, especially hotels and resorts. &lsquo;&rsquo;We want investors to come to this county and put up structures which are up to the required standards to avoid incidences of buildings collapsing,&rdquo; he said. Speaking during the rebranding of Havila Resort (formerly Sagana Grand River Camp), Ndathi said the tourist business along the circuit earns Sh300 million revenue annually. The resort stands along Sagana River which was in November last year declared by the National Olympic Committee as an Olympic site for Africa slalom and canoeing.
