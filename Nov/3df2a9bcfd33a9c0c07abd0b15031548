The controversy surrounding allocation of land in the expansive Solio Squatter Settlement Scheme in Laikipia is far from over. The National Land Commission (NLC) has directed its officials in Nyeri to probe the matter further. NLC Chairman Muhammad Swazuri in a letter dated October 31 this year directed Nyeri County Co-ordinator to intervene urgently and provide a report of its findings. This followed a petition sent by Social Watch, a local human rights body, to Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi, claiming that the settlement process was riddled with corruption and nepotism which locked out genuine squatters who were supposed to benefit from the land.
