A former senior land officer was yesterday charged with receiving a bribe. Charles Moraba, a former Lands registrar in Kisii, is accused of receiving Sh6,000 to help a resident involved in a land dispute. Mr Moraba is said to have refused to arbitrate the dispute and pressed for a bribe. Gladys Kwamboka narrated to the court how she frequented the land office seeking help in vain. She wanted the officer to travel to Suneka Bogitaa where she lived so he could establish the boundary of her land. &quot;The first time I went to the office to ask him to assist me, he refused and insisted that I should give him Sh6,000 for fuel and lunch before he could help me,&quot; said Ms Kwamboka. The witness also told court how she helped Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives to arrest the suspect after she reported to the matter to them. &quot;When I reported the matter to EACC, they told me I needed to record evidence showing that indeed, the officer wanted a bribe. I was given a tape recorder which I used to record him. I was also given treated cash, which I gave him,&quot; Kwamboka told court. Four more witnesses are lined up for the prosecution to prove the case against Moraba.
