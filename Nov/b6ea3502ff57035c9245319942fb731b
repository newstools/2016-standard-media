Esther Ruto hosted the former Marakwet East legislator for the training which brought together women leaders from all 25 wards in Bomet County.Kilimo used the opportunity to warn perpetrators of FGM that their days were numbered saying those who will attempt to conduct the exercise this festive season will be dealt with.She said: &quot;Government officers are on the lookout and those who will attempt will face the full force of the law. Administrators are on high alert and are under instruction to arrest and prosecute those found aiding the outlawed culture.&quot;Eng. Ruto who has been leading a campaign against FGM in the county said hot spots that still practice the vice had been mapped and a sensitization will be rolled out.&quot;We want to reach out to the areas using the women we are training today so that they can embrace alternative rights,&quot; Mrs. Ruto said.She said girls who recently cleared their KCPE exams were among vulnerable groups saying her campaign target the parents of such girls to encourage them educate rather than subject them to the vice for the sake of marriage.&quot;Many girls who have just completed their national exams are at risk of being subjected to FGM and we want parents to know that the girls are better educated than married off after the cut,&quot; she added.Kilimo said it was regrettable that stigma was driving the vice. She however said the law is clear on those stigmatizing others over FGM asking locals to speak out on those stigmatising others.&quot;The law on FGM is clear, even those who use vulgar language can be prosecuted and it is a high time to speak out and let the law takes its course so that the vice is dealt with once and for all,&quot; Kilimo said.
