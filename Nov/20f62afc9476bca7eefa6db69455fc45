We are all about what&#39;s trending on social Media and unfortunately, this past week it was nothing to smile about.Stories of cartels who use drugs to unhinge their victims before they rob them did rounds on social media like it was a raid. When I saw a warning message that asked to be forwarded at first I thought it was one of those chain messages that have no basis.The story was that of a victim who had sat between a stranger and the matatu driver just to find herself later in a cemetery, robbed and sexually abused. The second message was from a victim who escaped by a whisker, she fought her way out of the situation and even created enough buzz on social media to apprehend the criminals.The latest story was that of the lady who was drugged, while sitting in her own car in traffic by an individual who handed her a flyer.After all that has happened, for me it seems like a good idea to avoid empty matatu&#39;s, or any that have suspicious looking passengers. I would rather wait for the next full matatu than expose myself. For private cars, why not keep your windows and doors locked in crowded areas, just turn up the AC if it will ensure you are safe.Seems the city is quickly becoming&nbsp;an extremely dangerous place, especially for women, considering all the victims were female.So, what do we do to ensure that we are our brother /sister&#39;s keeper? As Kenyans we owe it to each other to recognise when another Kenyan is in trouble and do something about it, scream at the top of your lungs to attract attention if that will save a life.Let us look out for each other, if you were in danger, you would definitely want people to help.
