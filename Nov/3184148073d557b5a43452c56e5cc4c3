&nbsp;High-ranking Kilifi County officials have appeared before the county assembly&#39;s general oversight committee to shed light on the alleged mysterious disappearance of Sh45 million.County Health Executive Racheal Musyoka, Chief Officer Timothy Malingi, Senior Accountant Jacob Konde and other officials were questioned about the alleged loss on September 27 this year. It is claimed that the funds were lost through irregular Integrated Financial Management and Information System (Ifmis) and internet banking transactions.Officials from the County Department of Finance, who had also been summoned, did not appear before the committee Thursday.It was claimed at the hearing that Sh30 million was approved by the chief officer for health but he explained that the approval was automatic.MCAs heard that Sh15 million also disappeared from the county treasury in unclear circumstances.Financial transactions by departments go through various stages before reaching treasury via Ifmis and internet banking.Mr Konde explained that there are usually five passwords in a department to transact documents.Under Ifmis, a transaction undergoes invoicing, validation, approval by the chief officer and the accountant before payment.Mr Konde explained that at the treasury, there are usually two passwords, including the one for internet banking and the actual payment.&quot;Everyone has his or her own username and password, which should not be shared with anybody else; we are not allowed to share,&quot; he said.It emerged that transaction approvals were made in the departments of health, finance and roads.Committee members wondered how a transaction for one department was signed by an official from another department.It was also claimed that County Secretary Owen Baya knew of the scandal earlier than the health executive.Members heard that passwords for the officials implicated in the scandal were removed from the system a month later but they were still in office.
