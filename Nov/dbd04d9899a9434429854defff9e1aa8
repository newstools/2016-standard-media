In New York, thousands of protesters filled streets in midtown Manhattan as they made their way to Trump Tower, Trump&#39;s gilded home on Fifth Avenue. Hundreds of others gathered at a Manhattan park and shouted &quot;Not my president.&quot;In downtown Chicago, an estimated 1,800 people gathered outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower, chanting phrases like &quot;No Trump! No KKK! No racist USA.&quot;Chicago police closed roads in the area, impeding the demonstrators&#39; path. There were no immediate reports of arrests or violence there.&quot;I&#39;m just really terrified about what is happening in this country,&quot; said 22-year-old Adriana Rizzo in Chicago, who was holding a sign that read: &quot;Enjoy your rights while you can.&quot;In Seattle, police said they were responding to reports of a shooting with multiple victims near the scene of anti-Trump protests.
