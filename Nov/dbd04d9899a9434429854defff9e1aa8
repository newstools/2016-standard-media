USA: Throngs of demonstrators marched in cities across the United States on Wednesday to protest against Republican Donald Trump&#39;s surprise U.S. presidential election win, blasting his controversial campaign rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and other groups. In New York, thousands of protesters filled streets in midtown Manhattan as they made their way to Trump Tower, Trump&#39;s gilded home on Fifth Avenue. Hundreds of others gathered at a Manhattan park and shouted &quot;Not my president.&quot; In downtown Chicago, an estimated 1,800 people gathered outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower, chanting phrases like &quot;No Trump! No KKK! No racist USA.&quot; Chicago police closed roads in the area, impeding the demonstrators&#39; path. There were no immediate reports of arrests or violence there. &quot;I&#39;m just really terrified about what is happening in this country,&quot; said 22-year-old Adriana Rizzo in Chicago, who was holding a sign that read: &quot;Enjoy your rights while you can.&quot; READ MORE News media yet again caught flat-footed as they misread America's complex political pulse What Trump's win means to America, Kenya and the world Panic as 30,000 Kenyans face deportation under Trump regime In Seattle, police said they were responding to reports of a shooting with multiple victims near the scene of anti-Trump protests. Police said the shooting was unrelated to the demonstrations. Protesters railed against Trump&#39;s campaign pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico to keep immigrants from entering the United States illegally. Hundreds also gathered in Philadelphia, Boston and Portland, Oregon, on Wednesday evening, and organizers planned rallies in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, California. In Austin, the Texas capital, about 400 people marched through the streets, police said. A representative of the Trump campaign did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the protests. Trump said in his victory speech he would be president for all Americans, saying: &quot;It is time for us to come together as one united people.&quot; Earlier this month, his campaign rejected the support of a Ku Klux Klan newspaper and said that &quot;Mr. Trump and his campaign denounces hate in any form.&quot; GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
