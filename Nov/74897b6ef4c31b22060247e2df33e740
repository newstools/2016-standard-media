Police in Maralal yesterday impounded 35 gambling machines and arrested 19 people in an operation targeting illegal gambling sites.Speaking during the operation, Samburu Central Deputy Officer Commanding Police Divison Nathan Sanya said the gambling machines had prompted children to steal from their parents.&nbsp;He said gambling was also encouraging laziness among the youth as they tried to make money by chance. &nbsp;&quot;As you are aware, schools have closed and girls and boys are wasting time and money in illegal gambling joints,&quot; he said.Mr Sanya said the operation would continue to help parents discipline their children and ensure Maralal town became a crime-free zone.
