Deputy President William Ruto has assured residents of North Rift region that all development projects will be completed before next year&#39;s polls.His assurance followed constant complaints by locals regarding the sluggish manner in which most key projects were being handled.A number of them faulted the slow fulfillment of promises as a tactic used by politicians to seek votes every election year. Mr Ruto, considered the kingpin in Rift Valley, cleared the air on Sunday by outlining Jubilee&#39;s programmes that he said would benefit the agriculture-rich region before the 2017 General Election.UNFULFILLED PROJECTSLocal leaders led by Governor Jackson Mandago recently took issue with unfulfilled projects such as a bypass to ease congestion and the establishment of a dual carriageway from Eldoret International Airport.Mr Mandago urged Transport and Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James Macharia to act swiftly and ensure the projects took off.Speaking in Kapyemit, Turbo, the DP said plans were underway to build infrastructure in the region, and first on the agenda was the construction of a bypass.&quot;There has been a slow process with the World Bank but the process has been resolved and from January next year, construction will begin,&quot; said the DP.In 2014, Ruto announced plans for the establishment of multi-billion-shilling road bypasses in the Rift Valley.Among the main objectives of improved road infrastructure was aiding East African countries that use the route to transport goods from Mombasa besides decongesting traffic on the busy Kenya-Uganda highway.Some of the roads include Soy, Rivatex-Simat and Kesses, which have been the focus of frequent protests due to their poor state.On health, the DP said the Jubilee administration had made strides by elevating two medical facilities and upgrading their equipment to ease the congestion currently experienced at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital.On agriculture, the DP reiterated that farmers would sell their maize at an increased price of Sh3,000 per 90kg bag compared to the Sh2,300 that resulted in farmer demonstrations in Eldoret.The farmers insist that even as the national government works towards tapping into dairy farming, there is need to revert the management of New Kenya Co-operate Creameries to farmers.&quot;It is 13 years since we made the request. Farmers want to govern the facility so that they can also own market outlets even as they continue to rear animals,&quot; said Kenya Farmers Association Director Kipkorir Menjo.
