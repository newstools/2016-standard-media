&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} London:Parliament must accept that Britain&#39;s vote to leave the European Union was legitimate and let the government get on with delivering Brexit &#39;in full&#39;, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday. May has said she is confident of overturning a British court ruling that the government needs parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the EU. The ruling has provoked anger amongst ardent euroskeptics who fear lawmakers who supported staying in the bloc will try to water down the terms of Britain&#39;s exit. But, writing in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, May signaled she would resist any such attempts. &quot;The people made their choice, and did so decisively. It is the responsibility of the government to get on with the job and to carry out their instruction in full,&quot; May wrote.

The result was clear. It was legitimate,&quot; May said in a separate statement ahead of her first trade trip to India on Sunday. &quot;MPs and peers who regret the referendum result need to accept what the people decided.&quot; May will use her first bilateral trade trip since taking office to try to boost ties with India before Britain leaves the EU and to pave the way for a free trade deal as soon as possible once Brexit is completed. &nbsp; GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
