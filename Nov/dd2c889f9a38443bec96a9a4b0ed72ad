Counties did not meet their local revenue collection targets for the financial year (FY) 2015-16, a new report reveals. According to the Annual County Government Budget Implementation Review released on Monday by the Office of the Controller of Budget (OCOB), out of the targeted Sh50.5 billion, counties managed to raise Sh35.02 billion. Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo noted the amount collected by the counties represented 69.3 per cent of the annual target. Mrs Odhiambo said the collection was an increase of 3.5 per cent from the Sh33.85 billion generated in 2014-15. &ldquo;This was an improvement compared to Sh33.85 billion (67.2 per cent of FY 2014-15 annual revenue target),&rdquo; she said. She said only five counties managed to realise their annual revenue targets. They are Nakuru, Kericho, Laikipia, Trans Nzoia and Baringo counties.
