Kirinyaga Land County Executive member (CEC) Harry Mugo has resigned citing professional setbacks. The move came a day after a stormy cabinet meeting chaired by Governor Joseph Ndathi on Thursday, where grabbed public land matters were said to be on top of the agenda. Sources say Mugo was accused of sympathising with alleged land grabbers and declined to initiate legal means to revoke tittle deeds said to have been irregularly issued. He said he could no longer serve in a cabinet which was allegedly arm-twisting him to compromise his professional ethics on land maters. &#39;&#39;I am confirming that I am no longer in the Kirinyaga County Government having tendered my resignation letter on Friday,&#39;&#39; he said. He handed over his resignation letter to the County Secretary Mr Joe Muriuki on Friday.
