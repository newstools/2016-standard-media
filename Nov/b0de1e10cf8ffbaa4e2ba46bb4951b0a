What do farmers do? They till the land; they grow crops; they keep animals &ndash; like chicken, cows, sheep and goats.It therefore goes without saying they would want to know the characteristics of the soils at their disposal.Likewise, they would cherish something that cues at a cow&rsquo;s readiness for insemination: as opposed to reading a mucous lining and the cow&rsquo;s behaviour. And what about a gadget that will tally the number of eggs laid &ndash; and identify the specific chickens to have laid each egg? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be lovely too?Such a machine, it seems, may already be with us here in Kenya.Simple designA tag-team of futuristic thinkers has assembled different technologies to gift farmers &ndash; and countless other professionals &ndash; a gadget that does all that and more.Alfred Ahuta, the man behind the machine&rsquo;s software assemblage, says it detects the moisture, temperature and other soil profiles with an accuracy that nears 99 per cent.Maurice Mtange, his partner, is in charge of hardware design.&ldquo;Instead of relying on laboratories to pick soil samples and test, a process which is lengthy and time consuming, farmers can have this data with them at the farm,&rdquo; he says.Understanding soil characteristics of course is as important as arriving at an informed choice of the right crop to plant.But how does the know-it-all machine work?In one word, Ahuta says, &ldquo;sensors&rdquo;.The process is however more complex than that. Take for instance, the counting of eggs laid.Ahuta explains: &ldquo;The machine&rsquo;s sensor is calibrated to detect change in weight. When chicken eats it will record the increase in weight. When it excretes, the loss in weight is also captured. When a chicken lays an egg the change in weight is drastic. The sensor captures both the weight loss and the roll of an egg and interprets that through an algorithm as one egg laid.&rdquo;The chicken cage is fitted with a reader and the chicken with an RFID (Radio frequency identification detection) tag.&ldquo;The tag identifies the specific chicken that has laid the egg,&rdquo; Ahuta adds.Ahuta and his colleague are yet to name their invention.The technology, they say, is referred to as Internet of Things (IOT).The gadget not only records data; it stores the data on cloud. This information can be accessed by the farmer via a mobile phone with a GSM network or an internet enabled computer.Cost factor&ldquo;With this machine a maize farmer; a coffee farmer; a sorghum farmer, can find out prior if the soil conditions are perfect for such a venture. But also, they could identify steps necessary to improve the soil conditions close to optimum,&rdquo; says Ahuta.With the machine farmers will only need extension officers to interpret the data, &ldquo;to arrive at the right course of action,&rdquo; Ahuta says.Already a chicken farmer in Rongai has installed the machine and is primarily using it to count eggs.However, installing it for the average farmer may prove difficult as cost implications are exorbitant.&ldquo;A lot of the parts that make up the machine are imported: they are not available in our market. Importing them is therefore expensive.&rdquo;The average cost of assembling Ahuta&rsquo;s invention is Sh100,000.With all the stellar performance it promises the cost is a deterrent in making the gadget available to our farmers.&ldquo;If there is something like that; something that can tell me the amount of water to irrigate on my vegetable garden, it would help a lot especially for us who live in drought prone areas,&rdquo; says Monica Kitudu, a small scale farmer of vegetables in West Pokot.Monica uses a manual water pump to draw water from the banks of a seasonal river in Kongelai, West Pokot.She has to dig 10ft into the sand to make a pool from which she can pump water.She cherishes the idea that instead of spending all of her energy pumping water on her plot of kale, spinach and indigenous vegetables, she could irrigate with a precise amount of water.
