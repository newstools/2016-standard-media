Meru Governor Peter Munya is clearly enjoying attention as more people are fixated on the unravelling political events in Mt Kenya East following his takeover of the Party of National Unity (PNU).Munya, who has also been on the national spotlight for close to two years since his election and re-election as the Council of Governors (CoG) chairman, was unanimously picked as party leader at PNU&rsquo;s National Delegates Conference at the Bomas of Kenya on October 28.His elevation to the helm of the party that propelled former President Mwai Kibaki to a second term, was after a protracted battle between him and those opposed to his takeover, and many of them now in the Jubilee Party (JP). But Munya came out smiling after the Political Parties Tribunal decree that PNU had not merged with others in forming the JP, the party President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto want to run for re-election on.Governor Munya said he intends to run for re-election in 2017 on PNU&rsquo;s ticket and use it to run for the presidency in 2022.Re-election chances&ldquo;We have started the journey to State House in 2022,&rdquo; Munya said, adding that PNU&rsquo;s rallying point is the entrenchment and protection of devolution which had brought services closer to people.Political analysts say PNU is the party to watch in the run up to the 2017 election, as many political heavyweights may seek refuge in it if JP nominations are not seen to be free and fair.Munya&rsquo;s takeover of PNU has caught the eye of many, and his handlers say he wants to have as many aspirants as possible and those disenchanted with Jubilee and other parties, find a political home in PNU.&ldquo;I and many other MCAs are in PNU because we regard it as a Meru party, just as JP is composed mainly of Kikuyus and Kalenjins. PNU is our boat to State House in 2022,&rdquo; said George Kalinga, the Antubetwe-Kiongo MCA.Some 38 MCAs of the 69 that make the County Assembly of Meru were at PNU&rsquo;s NDC to witness Munya&rsquo;s coronation at Bomas of Kenya.Munya&rsquo;s move, says Joseph Ntarangwi, boosted his re-election chances. &ldquo;The big number of Meru MCAs at PNU&rsquo;s NDC should not escape notice. It is a statement that PNU will be in a fierce battle with Jubilee Party in all elective positions, except the presidency because Munya has said he is supporting Uhuru in 2017,&rdquo; added Ntarangwi, an ally of the Meru governor.But it remains to be seen how PNU will fair in neighbouring counties where big contests at nomination stage are imminent.While JP co-architect Kiraitu Murungi and others have maintained there will be free and fair nominations, there are widespread fears the primaries will be rigged.Linford Mutembei, the Chairman of the Mount Kenya Youth Caucus, a group leaning towards the JP, says the fallout from a bungled nominations will benefit PNU.&ldquo;PNU is a real threat, at least in Mount Kenya East, in case the nominations are marred with irregularities. JP nominations have to be free and fair at all cost. Otherwise PNU will be waiting on the wings to welcome those who doubt they will be that,&rdquo; said Mr Mutembei.Political unity&nbsp;Senator Kiraitu and Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi, who are running for governor and senator respectively, have dismissed PNU&rsquo;s chances.Kiraitu said his decision to fold his Alliance Party of Kenya alongside TNA and URP was to achieve political unity for Kenya.&ldquo;I had my bus and Uhuru and Ruto had their even bigger vehicles. Others had their carts and bicycles. We were all on the road but there was a sea to cross.&ldquo;That is why we decided to build a big ship called Jubilee Party but there are others who want to cross it with their bicycles,&rdquo; Kiraitu said, adding that Munya&rsquo;s move to embrace the PNU is going against the dream.
