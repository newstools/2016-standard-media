This year&#39;s US presidential elections is projected to be the most expensive with an estimated figure of US 6.6 billion dollars (Sh 668.3 billion -using the current Sh 101.25 exchange rate) more than the US 6.3 billion dollars spent in 2012. Even with this amount in mind, Republican nominee Donald Trump has personally contributed US 56 million dollars to his own campaigns while his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton has received large donations both individuals and groups. The US federal Election Commission, which is an equivalent of Kenya&#39;s the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commissions (IEBC) monitors the donations each person gets, setting the limits of what a presidential candidate can receive and spend from individual donations at US 2,700 dollars (Sh 270,000) for the primaries and US 2,700 dollars (Sh270,000) after party nominations. At the State level, the candidates&#39; individual donations stand at US 100 dollars (Sh 10,000). However at both levels, there is no limit to how much one can receive as contribution from outside groups or to their campaign committees. Despite Clinton and Trump raising over Sh120billion individually for campaigns, Trump has personally funded his over 25 percent yet the support base is still lukewarm.

However, compared to US and Kenya, the presidential candidates will be limited to spending US 51.8 million dolars (Sh 5.25 billion), while those contesting for the governor/senator/ women representative seats will be allowed to spend up to US 4.3 million dollars (Sh433 million). Also the political parties will be allowed to receive up to US 148.2 million dollars (Sh15.03 billion) in contributions with a single source limited to US 29.5 million dollars (Sh 3 billion). The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has said in a Kenya Gazette notice Thursday that for an aspiring MP, he or she will be required to spend up to Ksh33.4 million ($330,000) while a contestant for an member of the county assembly (MCA&#39;s) seat is allowed up to Ksh10.3 million ($101,000). Governor, Senators and Women representatives for Counties like Nairobi will be allowed to spend over 400 million while aspirants for similar seats in Lamu will only spend over 13 million. It&#39;s not a coincidence with Kenya although Americans laud the regulations, saying it good to promote accountability. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
