A boda boda operator who has been missing for three weeks has left his family in distress. Hillary Kipkoech Kemboi, a father of two, was reported as missing on October 24 at Salgaa shopping centre, where his family members had taken him for medication. According to his wife Winnie Chemutai, Mr Kemboi started acting weird after he went home on the fateful day. Chemutai said her husband called her to where he was seated and asked that she untie a rope that tied his legs and shoes. This, she said, puzzled her more and she headed to a neighbour&rsquo;s home who took Kemboi to Salgaa for medical assistance. &ldquo;I did not know what was happening. His condition just worsened and we had to seek assistance from neighbours,&rdquo; she said.
