A section of Bukhungu stadium which is under construction has collapsed leaving one person injured. The cause of the collapse is yet to be established as the county government has called on county civil engineers to investigate it.According to the County Executive Member for Sports Robert Sumbi, part of the section that collapsed was to be demolished to comply with CAF requirements.&ldquo;CAF toured the stadium to see the ongoing construction and they recommended that some parts on the VIP section be removed to enhance the standard work. The contractor removed some part and the part that collapsed was to be removed also,&rdquo; said Sumbi. He said CAF authorised that some of the section should be redesigned to meet the international standards. &ldquo;CAF approved the construction of the stadium when they visited us three weeks ago. However, they told us to redesign some parts so that the stadium meets the international standards,&rdquo; he said.However, MCAs&nbsp;Cleophas Malala (Mahiakalo) and Alex Khamasi (nominated) asked the county government to stop the construction.They said the contractor was rushing to beat the December deadline thus engaging in substandard work. &ldquo;This building is weak and the contractor should stop it until investigation and audit is done to check if the building is worth. We will take the matter seriously to ensure those responsible are accountable for it,&rdquo; said Malala.The first phase of construction is expected to be completed by December this year. The county government is expected to spend Sh 1 billion on the stadium to upgrade it to international standard with phase one expected to cost Sh 400 million.Once completed the stadium will host over 30,000 people with its automated gates used to collect revenue. The project is one the mega projects by the Governor Wycliffe Oparanya-led administration.
