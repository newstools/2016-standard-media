Police were forced to shoot in the air to disperse rival groups during protests over reported theft of Sh51 million. Chaos erupted in Kilifi Town after hundreds of protesters stormed the office of Governor Amason Kingi demanding his removal over the loss of the money. The demonstrators reportedly broke into the governor&#39;s office with a view to ejecting him so that a forensic audit can be carried out on the county bank accounts. However, Kingi was not at his office when the group of about 80 youths stormed in. The personnel manning the office took off as the crowds charged towards them, chanting slogans against Kingi and ODM leader Raila Odinga. They accused Raila of attempting to shield Kingi from investigations over the theft. Later, Kingi condemned the attack on his office, which he blamed on his political enemies who he said sponsored the protests.

Activities at the county headquarters came to a standstill as the youths scared away workers. At least 10 county government officials, whose passwords were reportedly stolen and used to wire the money to accounts of five suspect firms have been suspended. During his visit to the county, Raila defended Kingi, who he said had done well by blowing the whistle over the theft and suspending the officers. Jubilee later accused Raila of double standards in the war against corruption by attacking the government and looking the other way when it involves ODM officials. However, Raila has asked the government to borrow Kingi&#39;s example in the war against corruption.
