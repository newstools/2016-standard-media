Public servants have begun tendering in their resignations as they eye elective positions in next year&rsquo;s General Election. The move comes as various political parties start to prepare for party nominations scheduled for early February and March next year. Commission on Administrative of Justice chairperson Otiende Amollo, who is eyeing the Rarieda parliamentary seat currently held by Nicholas Gumbo, has already resigned. Mr Gumbo has declared intent to run for the Siaya governor&rsquo;s seat, as the incumbent, Cornel Rasanga, welcomed competitors, saying he was sure of defeating them in a free and fair contest. In Migori, Governor Zachary Obado&rsquo;s legal advisor, Tom Kwanga, has also resigned to run for the Rongo parliamentary seat, currently held by Dalmas Otieno.

Although he still has intentions to defend the seat, the once-towering and vocal politician has been missing in active politics for close to two years. It is his constituency managers who have been running his development projects while he is away on the peace keeping ambassadorial duties delegated to him by the Head of State. Former Energy Minister Ochillo Ayacko was the first to set the pace, when he quit his plum parastatal job early this year to declare interest in the Migori governor&rsquo;s seat, currently held by Mr Obado. Mr Ayacko was the chairman and chief executive of the Nuclear Power Agency. Since he resigned, he has been giving his opponent sleepless nights with his countywide night haul meetings and social campaign networks aimed at capturing the seat. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
