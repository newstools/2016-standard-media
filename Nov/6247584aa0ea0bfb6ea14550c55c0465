Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has castigated the Murang&#39;a County government for failing to pay health workers. The legislator has accused the county of misplaced priorities in public funds management and asked the executive to pay the workers without any further delay. The legislator noted that it is ironical that the county, for instance, can afford to spend Sh3 million on advertisements and fail to pay the health workers. Health workers went on strike on Tuesday because of the delayed salaries and non-remittance of statutory deductions. Mr Kamau asked EACC and other State organs to investigate where the deducted funds are taken.
