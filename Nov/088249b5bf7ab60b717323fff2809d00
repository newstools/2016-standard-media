A top lawyer is embroiled in a suspected taxation&nbsp;fraud&nbsp;involving Sh378 million, which includes un-remitted employees&rsquo; income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;in a matter before court. Prof Tom&nbsp;Ojienda, also a member of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), has effectively been branded&nbsp;tax&nbsp;non-compliant and had his request for conformity certificate turned down. The Kenya Revenue Authority says the lawyer has evaded&nbsp;tax&nbsp;on his income as legal fees estimated at Sh1.1 billion received from Mumias Sugar Company and the Nairobi County Government. &ldquo;KRA has a payroll that he (Prof&nbsp;Ojienda) never deducted and remitted his employees&rsquo; income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;as required by the law,&rdquo; James Mburu, a deputy commissioner of KRA, says in an affidavit filed in court last week. It is impossible to tell from the court documents the size of Prof Tom&nbsp;Ojienda&nbsp;and Associates&rsquo; staff, whose unremitted income&nbsp;taxes&nbsp;&mdash; also known as Pay As You Earn &mdash; forms the basis of the suit. Taxes&nbsp;accruing from payments received by the firm as settlements for legal fees were under-declared in the annual personal returns filed by the lawyer, KRA says.

Ojienda&nbsp;says in the original application that some of the funds in the bank accounts audited for&nbsp;tax&nbsp;assessment by KRA were not his income, but rather clients&rsquo; money held in trust. Clients&rsquo; money &ldquo;KRA acted illegally by purporting to assess the applicants&rsquo; clients&rsquo; accounts for taxation wherein they contain clients&rsquo; money,&rdquo; reads&nbsp;Ojienda&rsquo;s&nbsp;petition. He has since sought intervention of John Njiraini, the Commissioner General of KRA,&nbsp;claiming&nbsp;his offices in Nakuru were raided by officers from the&nbsp;tax&nbsp;authority who also arrested his workers. But in the ensuing court filings, the&nbsp;tax&nbsp;agency says there was no documentation to support&nbsp;Ojienda&rsquo;s&nbsp;claims&nbsp;that funds in the bank account belonged to his clients. &ldquo;...the said documents did not demonstrate instances when allowances, clients&rsquo; money and disbursements were deposited into the accounts&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;to be client accounts as had been requested to enable the KRA amend the assessments appropriately,&rdquo; Mburu says. Mburu says the law professor had attacked him personally in the instance where&nbsp;Ojienda&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;the&nbsp;tax&nbsp;claim&nbsp;and subsequent alleged harassment smacked of ethnic bias. Counter-accusation between Mburu and&nbsp;Ojienda&nbsp;of malice are turning out to be an interesting sideshow to the suit that has also drawn in Dr Robert Ayisi, the Nairobi County Secretary, who&nbsp;claims&nbsp;to have been frog-marched by KRA officers. Ayisi was arrested allegedly for declining to reveal crucial information to KRA on the payments made by the county to&nbsp;Ojienda&nbsp;and his law firm. He has since sued for harassment and humiliation, following his arrest and brief detention at the Times Tower &mdash; KRA&rsquo;s head offices along Haile Selassie Avenue. He sued KRA in the Constitution and Human Rights Division of the High Court three weeks ago, seeking protection from the revenue agency. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
