A group of politicians in Mt Elgon Constituency have teamed up in a bid to unseat area MP John Serut in the coming elections. Serut, who contested the seat as an independent candidate, beat&nbsp;former area MP Fred Kapondi and businessman Harry Kimtai. The anti-Serut team has Bungoma County Deputy Governor Hillary Chongwony, businessman Peter Sirai, county Public Administration executive Mokin Ptang&#39;uny and the governor&#39;s gender adviser Jenipher Mbatiany. They said they will ensure one of them captures the seat on Jubilee ticket. The Jubilee Party aspirants seeking the seat met in Bungoma Town yesterday and set up a campaign team to spearhead the party&#39;s activities in the region. &quot;Our main goal is to unseat the MP. We want to send him to political oblivion because he has failed us. There are no tangible projects we have seen on the ground. We want to send him home,&quot; said Chongwony who chairs the team.
