US President Barrack Obama&#39;s half brother, Malik, has confessed to have voted for Donald Trump.Mr Malik, who has made stinging criticism of Obama&#39;s presidency, said he was among early voters who voted on October 31.&quot;What is the big fuss. I&#39;m exercising my democratic right to vote for my choice,&quot; Malik told The Standard. Mr Obama backed Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton. Malik said development in Kogelo came through the government of President Mwai Kibaki, which installed electricity and tarmacked the N&#39;giya-Ndori road on the belief Obama would visit his Alego home as President, which never happened.&quot;I have built bridges, roads, water wells, houses for prayers, houses for widows and orphans, provided scholarships, fed and clothed the poor, and promoted peace in Kogelo, Siaya, Kenya and the rest of the world. I love my brother Barack Obama but he has been a big disappointment,&quot; he said.Voters in the US go to the polls today to pick their 45th President to take over from Obama.Residents of Kogelo, Obama&#39;s rural home in Kenya, are some of the people who seem to be more excited about the polls, probably second to the US voters.The family has been in the limelight for both good and wrong reasons, and this election seems to have been the peak of the family&#39;s public exposure.Malik has gone against the family&#39;s presidential choice and supported the Republican candidate, Mr Trump.The other family members, led by Mama Sarah Obama, are in prayers that Ms Clinton clinches the seat, to push on with Obama&#39;s policies.&quot;My grandson has done his part effectively and I pray God gives American people someone who will further the good things he did. He has been humble and accommodating to people from different cultures, religions and tribes, and that is what we see in Hillary,&quot; said Sarah.And as the US goes to the polls, Kogelo residents will be conducting a mock election at Kogelo shopping centre, similar to one held during Obama&#39;s first presidential battle against John Mc&#39;Cain in 2008.Up to yesterday, preparations were underway for the mock election, with organisers confirming Mama Sarah will be the first one to vote at 9am.
