In Donald Trump, the United States elected a president as opposite to Barrack Obama as can be. Twice, in 2008 and 2012, American voters chose a 48-year-old, urbane, liberal black man; now in 2016, they have elected a 70-year-old, unrepentantly coarse white man. Is that not America? &quot;The path that this country has taken has never been a straight line,&quot; said Obama said on Wednesday. &quot;We zig and we zag.&quot; Obama, the zig, was a guy so cool in the eyes of much of the world that he got a Nobel Peace Prize before he had a chance to do much. Trump, the zag, is a hurler of insults, a raw orator you cannot turn away from if you can bring yourself to tune in, a boor with women, a peddler of falsehoods that made millions of eyes roll but spoke a larger truth in the eyes of his supporters.

Now they fade in an increasingly diverse country. Obama came to national attention with a speech of poetry and power that dreamed of red states and blue states joined spiritually as united states. It took the breath away from some Republicans as well as many Democrats. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
