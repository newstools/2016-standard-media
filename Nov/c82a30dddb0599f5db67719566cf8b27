Wiper Democratic Movement has written to a governor and six MPs deemed to have defected to show&nbsp;cause why the should not be punished.The move comes a day after its coalition partner, ODM, gave nine elected leaders it expelled last week another chance to defend themselves after they individually appealed against expulsion. In a letter signed by Secretary General Hassan Omar, Wiper wants Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and MPs John Munuve (Mwingi North), Katemi Makenga (Kaiti), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Robert Mutemi (nominated), Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central) and Kisoi Munyao of Mbooni to show cause why the should not be punished.Dr Mutua, who was elected on a Wiper ticket, has seven days to show cause why he should not be subjected to disciplinary action. Party sources told The Standard on Saturday the MPs have also been served.The letter to Mutua reads in part: &ldquo;By resolution of the NEC meeting of November 2, 2016 and pursuant to Section 14 (7) of the Political Parties Act and Article 29.3 of the Wiper Democratic Movement constitution, we hereby give you notice to show cause in writing within seven days addressed to the chairperson of the Party Disciplinary Committee ... as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against you and to effect your resignation from the Party.&rdquo;Love-hate relationshipThe letter comes hot on the heels of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held on November 2, 2016 where the party decided to crack the whip on leaders deemed to have defected.&ldquo;On numerous occasions, you have made statements and conducted yourself in contravention of the Political Parties Act 2011 and in particular section 14(5),&rdquo; read the letter.Mutua has enjoyed a love-hate relationship with Wiper and has openly gone against the grain in a region where the party enjoys massive support.The governor launched Maendeleo Chap Chap Movement to counter Wiper influence in the region and has been close to the ruling Jubilee coalition, a move seen to be undermining Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&rsquo;s influence.Mutua has also had a frosty relationship with Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama who will most likely support another candidate in 2017.In the letter, Mutua is accused of having &ldquo;overtly, formed and joined in the formation of; joined; publicly advocated for the formation of another political party and have and continue to promote the ideology, interests and policies of a rival party. By the overt contravention of this provision, you are deemed to have resigned from the Wiper Democratic Movement &ndash; Kenya.&rdquo;During the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Machakos, Kalonzo asked the Wipre rebels to stop issuing ultimatums. This came after a section of MPs led by Mutambu and Munyao asked Kalonzo to convene a meeting and show the way forward for the community.Only last week, ODM kicked out Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba, who was ODM&rsquo;s secretary-general, Joash Maangi (Deputy Governor, Kisii), MPs Steven Kariuki (Mathare), Isaac Mwaura (nominated), Zainab Chidzuga (Kwale woman rep), Samwel Arama (Nakuru West), Masoud Mwahima (Likoni), John Waluke (Sirisia) and Viwandani MCA Samwel Nyangwara from the party over their association with Jubilee.But a letter signed by acting Secretary General Agnes Zani asked the leaders to file appeals not later than November 10, 2016.It was a response to a letter by lawyer Kioko Kilukumi on behalf of the leaders who faulted the party&rsquo;s resolved to strike out from its list of members.The letter reads: &ldquo;This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 01/11/2016 appealing against the disciplinary action the Party organs took on nine (9) of its members.&rdquo;The leaders may lose their seats if the Registrar of Political Parties effects the request of ODM to have the de-registered. This move will most likely result into by-elections.Dr Zani, speaking to The Standard on Saturday, said the party had resolved to deal with the cases individually since the basis for the action taken was distinct.Case to answer&ldquo;They appeared individually with a case to answer and were given a chance to defend themselves individually. Therefore, they cannot appeal as a group but on individual basis,&rdquo; said Zani.Zani says different actions were taken based on recommendations made by the relevant organs of the party.&nbsp;The party then moved to de-whip the rebels from the various house committees.Most of those affected have openly shown dalliance with Jubilee Party, some of them claiming they were working with the ruling coalition in order to attract development to their areas.
