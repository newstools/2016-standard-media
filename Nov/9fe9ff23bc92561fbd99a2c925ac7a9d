Nine months to the General Election, three CORD parties have planned meetings to endorse presidential candidates. The planned events come barely a month after President Uhuru Kenyatta of Jubilee Party and Raila Odinga of ODM held their National Governing Council meetings at Bomas of Kenya to set off their presidential campaigns. Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s Wiper party, Moses Wetang&#39;ula&#39;s Ford-Kenya and Musalia Mudavadi&#39;s Amani National Congress also have major meetings in three weeks&#39; time to formally receive their respective parties&#39; endorsements.
