Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery has accused ODM leader Raila Odinga of politicising conservation of Mau Forest. Mr Nkaissery, who spoke in Narok, accused Raila of using the forest to woo the Maasai by purporting to speak for them. &quot;He should stop making it look like the problems facing Mau Forest started with the Jubilee administration. These challenges started a long time ago and the current government will soon get a permanent solution,&quot; he said. The CS urged the community to support Jubilee. He dismissed ODM, saying Narok is a Jubilee zone. He also revealed President Kenyatta will soon make his first visit to the county to launch projects.
