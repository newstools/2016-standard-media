When he was arrested and charged in August 16, 2001 with murder, Charo Salimu knew his case would take just a few months before a verdict is pronounced. Unknown to him, it would take 15 years for his case to be concluded. All the while, Shimo la Tewa Prison was his home. After he was arrested, he was kept in custody for two years until June 5, 2003, when the trial begun and the Director of Public Prosecutions called the first witness, who turned to be the deceased man&#39;s widow. From 2003, the trial failed to proceed and Salimu had to stay in remand until March 28, 2007, when he was taken back to court. By then, his hopes for a speedy trial were quickly fading away. This was confirmed when the trial was cancelled with the judge ruling that the trial for murder to start afresh. The case took another break until June 26, 2009, when the prosecution called two other witnesses. Before the case could conclude, the presiding judge Justice Leonard Njagi was transferred from Mombasa in September 2009 and Lady Justice Maureen Odero took over from him.

But Salimu appealed against the conviction, arguing that the long delay of 10 years before his case was concluded had led to a mistrial and that the judge failed to appreciate that the witnesses had changed their testimonies with the passage of time. His prayers were answered on July 19, 2016, when three appellate judges found that he was unfairly tried after being kept in prison for over 10 years and acquitted him. Appellate judges Asike Makhandia, William Ouko and Kathurima M&#39;Inoti ruled that it was wrong for Justice Omondi to convict Salimu after staying in remand for 16 years.
