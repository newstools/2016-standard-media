Cases&nbsp;that have been in court for&nbsp;over&nbsp;five&nbsp;years&nbsp;will be given priority to eliminate a backlog, Chief Justice David Maraga has said.&nbsp; Speaking at the Bungoma Law Courts yesterday after opening a new court housing, Mr Maraga&nbsp;said&nbsp;cases&nbsp;that are&nbsp;overfive&nbsp;years&nbsp;old would be dispensed with in a special session. &quot;Long&nbsp;cases&nbsp;without applicants will be dismissed as they are delaying the process in court and causing the backlog which is a tedious process. We need to dismiss them so that the concerned authorities can concentrate on other&nbsp;cases&nbsp;which should be given an upper hand,&quot; he said. He added that the Judiciary was working to address the challenges at the Land Dispute Tribunal. He said a majority of the&nbsp;cases&nbsp;in court are related to land disputes. The Chief Justice noted that some&nbsp;cases&nbsp;should be solved at home by elders to avoid jamming courts with&nbsp;cases&nbsp;that can find societal solutions. He urged Kenyans to find alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to help speed up other court processes hence help reduce many&nbsp;cases&nbsp;that end up in court.
