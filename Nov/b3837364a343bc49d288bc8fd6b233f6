The two were attacked with crude weapons by the thugs after they raised an alarm.Two phones and an unknown amount of money were stolen.The body of the man was found hanging on the roof of the house with both hands and legs tied and blood bespattered in the house.His body was taken to St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital mortuary in Mumias.Area assistant chief Shaban Nyapola confirmed the incident that took place less than 300 metres from Matungu Police Station.Defiled girl&ldquo;A sack we suspect they used to carry their weapons and a panga were recovered. This is the first incident to happen in the area in the recent past and we hope we will arrest the perpetrators,&rdquo; said the assistant chief.It is believed the thugs entered the home after monitoring every movement of the people.No arrest has been made but police have launched a manhunt for the suspects.The family of the victims has appealed to the local authority to bring the culprits to book for justice to prevail.The incident highlights the increasing cases of insecurity in the county.Hardly five days ago, three people were injured when a machete-wielding gang struck Marakusi village in Lugari.A woman was raped and a nine-year-old girl defiled during the attack.Last week, six thugs gang-raped a woman and her daughter-in-law at Bondeni village again in Lugari after they broke into their house at night.
