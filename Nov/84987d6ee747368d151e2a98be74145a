US President Barack Obama&#39;s half-brother, Malik, was over the moon as he celebrated the election of Republican Donald Trump. Malik, who on Tuesday predicted the defeat of Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton, rushed to Twitter to celebrate Trump&rsquo;s victory, saying &quot;God is Great&quot;. Malik fell out with President Obama and the entire family after he chose to support Trump. Elders from his Kogelo village where President Obama&#39;s father - Barack Obama snr - grew up, at one time threatened to curse him if he continued &quot;embarrassing&quot; the family. Yesterday, he dared the elders to make good their threat as he heaped praise on Trump. &quot;All thanks and praises to Allah, God Almighty. I prayed for Barack Obama, he won; I prayed for Mr Trump, he won. God does as He pleases,&quot; said Malik on his Twitter handle. On Tuesday, Malik fired another blistering attack against the outgoing US President and his other family members, saying they cannot stop him from supporting Trump.
