Construction of the Sh1.16 billion Ibokolo-Shianda road in Mumias East has started. The 23km stretch is among roads President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to tarmac before 2017. The road connects Butere, Mumias East and Navakholo and is expected to be completed by August 2017. Speaking at the construction site yesterday, Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali said the road will contribute towards the economic growth of the region through trade. &nbsp;&ldquo;The road has been in a pathetic condition for long. The Government has finally honoured its promise to the people of Kakamega and started construction of the road,&rdquo; Mr Washiali said. &nbsp; READ MORE Blame game over Kisii building that killed eight Scholar wants sand packaged in 50kg bags, sold in hardware shops Police arrest owner of collapsed Kisii building
