BBC Worldwide and Zuku TV have signed a new deal that will see the CBeebies channel launched on the Zuku platform. CBeebies is a multi-platform brand for pre-schoolers aged six years and under, which encourages children to learn through play. &ldquo;The channel is home to some of the most entertaining and educational programmes for young children and given that the African continent has one of the youngest populations globally, we&rsquo;re excited to be able to give new viewers on the Zuku platform access to such popular kids&rsquo; programmes,&rdquo; said Joel Churcher, vice president and general manager for Africa, BBC Worldwide.
