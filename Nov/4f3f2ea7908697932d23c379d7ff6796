A pastoralist&nbsp;in&nbsp;Narok South incurred&nbsp;Sh400,000 in losses after a hyena&nbsp;killed over 50 sheep and goats yesterday. Parwat ole Kool and his son Michael Kool are staring at starvation after the livestock, which is their only source of livelihood, were killed by the wild animal which had been wreaking havoc in Maji Moto village. &ldquo;It was around 2am at night when we heard the goats bleat fiercely. We came out but unfortunately when we entered the sheep pen, we were shocked to see carcasses strewn all over. We are at a big loss,&rdquo; Mr Kool said. He said they had a total of 100 sheep and goats, adding that&nbsp;the family of 17 depended on the livestock for food and income.
