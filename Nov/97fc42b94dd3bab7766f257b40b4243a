Governors from coffee-growing&nbsp;counties&nbsp;are pushing for control of the sector&rsquo;s marketing process. The&nbsp;county&nbsp;chiefs want the national government to surrender powers to&nbsp;licence marketers to them. Council of Governors (CoG) Agriculture Committee chairman Nderitu Gachagua said they also want a&nbsp;say&nbsp;in coffee milling. Should they have their way, farmers are likely to benefit from increased direct sales of coffee in international markets. Today, this is not possible due to numerous licences and the bureaucracy involved. Yesterday, Gachagua, who is also the Nyeri Governor, said for the coffee farmers&rsquo; fortunes to improve, licensing should be eased by giving&nbsp;county&nbsp;governments powers to issue the permits. After all, he added, agriculture is a devolved function. &ldquo;A team has since been appointed, comprising officials from CoG and the national government to address the issue, which we feel is weighing farmers down,&rdquo; the governor revealed.&nbsp; READ MORE Kenyans starve as plenty crops rot in farms Ray of hope as coffee marketing model doubles farmers' earnings Already, there is a matter in court where governors are challenging the implementation of a Kenya Gazette supplement legal notice by the Ministry of Agriculture that enacted the coffee (general) regulations 2016.
