A senior county official was yesterday jailed for one month for contempt of court. Justice Linnet Ndolo of the Milimani Employment and Labour Relations Court found&nbsp;Kitui acting county secretary Alex Kimanzi guilty of contempt of court for violating orders directing that he reinstates former deputy director for health and sanitation Evans Mumo. The court, however, gave the county secretary an option of paying a Sh1 million fine. In her first ruling on May 31, this year, Justice Ndolo had quashed the sacking of Dr Mumo and directed that he be reinstated. The county government failed to obey the orders. Instead of reinstating the sacked officer, the county sent Mumo on compulsory leave.

Also charged was the chairperson of county public service board, Ms Rose Masya and Fredrick Muli who had replaced Mumo as deputy director for health and sanitation. Kimanzi, who was the first respondent both in his official and private capacity, was punished but his co-accused were spared by the court. &quot;That Alex Kimanzi knowingly and willfully violated orders of the court granted on May 31, 2016 and is hereby cited for contempt of court,&quot; Justice Ndolo said in her ruling. Ndolo had termed Mumo&#39;s sacking by Governor Julius Malombe, Mr Kimanzi and a probe committee chaired by a Mr Mwongela Munyoki, as unlawful. She further ordered that the applicant be reinstated to his position without any loss of pay or benefits; and that the respondents pay the costs of the suit. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
