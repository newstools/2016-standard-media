Gangsters raided a factory and took off with 63 bags of&nbsp;coffee valued at almost Sh2 million. The criminals stormed&nbsp;Ragati Coffee Factory in Ndia Constituency at about 10pm on Saturday and rounded up four guards on duty before packing the beans into gunny bags labelled, &ldquo;Arabica Coffee, a produce of Tanzania&rdquo;. Ragati&nbsp;is one of the 10 factories under Kibirigwe Coffee Co-operative Society and produces one of the top grades of the commodity, according to the society&rsquo;s chairman Joseph Maina. Mr Maina, who was among the farmers who rushed to the factory after they learnt about the incident, said the gangsters left some of the gunny bags with the Tanzanian label within the premises. He said two other factories had been raided in the recent past. &ldquo;The first robbery took place at Kiangai Coffee Factory where our night guard was killed by the gangsters but they were repulsed before they could steal any parchment from the store,&rdquo; the official said.
