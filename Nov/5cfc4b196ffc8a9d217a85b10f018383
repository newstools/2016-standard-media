LAMU, KENYA: The fishing community in remote parts of Lamu archipelago has reason to smile after the County government started building several diesel generator-powered cold storage facilities and ice plants to spur the fishing industry.Units of modern cold storage warehouses and ice plants are coming up in the remote fishing islands of Kiunga, Kiwayu, Kizingitini, Faza and Mokowe at a combined cost of Sh50 million to boost the local fishing industry in the archipelago.Lamu Governor Issa Timamy says the old storage facilities and fish markets in the coastal villages will enable fishermen to keep their catch fresh for long and control prices. He explained that for generations fishing has been a key source of income in Lamu but decried that lack of cold storage facilities has bogged down the sector.Timamy said majority of the island dwellers rely on fishing but lack of ice plants and the use of traditional fishing gear has bogged down the business in the coastal county.He said the county government is also scouting for markets in other countries to enable the Lamu fishermen reap maximum benefits from their fishing ventures.The county boss says his administration is taking deliberate steps to make the fishing sector lucrative and vibrant so as to serve as &#39;a source of employment and improve livelihoods&#39;.&#39;&#39;Local fishermen cannot dictate the right price for their fish due to their inability to keep their catches fresh&#39;&#39;, said Timamy.
