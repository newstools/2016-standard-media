&nbsp; NYERI: A 21-year-old man on Friday disrupted prayers at the busy Majengo mosque in Nyeri County after he climbed at the top of the mosque&#39;s minaret and threatened to take his own life. The man, identified by the locals as Hassan Hussein caused a three-hour standoff that attracted hundreds of residents who begged him not to commit suicide. Women who had come for the afternoon prayers, including Hussein&#39;s mother Hadija Wambui broke into tears as they pleaded with the young man to climb down from the over 20 feet tower. Speaking to the press, Wambui said his son started showing signs of stress following the death of his younger brother late last year. &quot;His brother died after being hit by a billiard ball at a pool table centre in Nyeri town. He was preparing to sit for his KCPE exams, however the man who hit him was arrested and later set free,&quot; Wambui explained.
