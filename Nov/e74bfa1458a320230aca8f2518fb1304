A magistrate who pulled out of a narcotics case that saw a ship destroyed through an executive order has been directed to finalise it. Last month,&nbsp;Mombasa Chief Magistrate Julius Nang&#39;ea disqualified himself from hearing a case in which five people were charged with drug trafficking. This was after President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the destruction of the ship which allegedly carried the narcotics. Nange&#39;a argued that the destruction of the vessel amounted to state interference and demonstrated a blatant disregard for the rule of law and for the courts. Nang&#39;ea cited State interference after officials led by Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery, Chief of Defence Forces General Joseph Mwathethe and Coast Regional Co-ordinator Nelson Marwa supervised the destruction at sea of the yacht, MV Baby Iris, that the suspects allegedly used to transport the narcotics valued at Sh22 million. He abandoned the case saying he could no longer entertain State interference in the trial following the August 14, 2015 State-sanctioned destruction of the Singaporean flagged yacht on which the suspects were allegedly arrested and which the police claim heroin was found.

But yesterday, the administrator of the magistrate courts in Mombasa rejected the decision by Nange&#39;a and directed the reluctant magistrate to conclude the case, terming his withdrawal as &quot;unreasonable.&quot; After pulling out of the trial, Nang&#39;ea placed the file before Mombasa Chief Magistrate Teresia Muthoka, who is the administrator of magistrate courts, to allocate a new magistrate. Muthoka acknowledged that the destruction of the boat was a blow to the rule of law, but insisted that Nange&#39;a must return to the case because he is the only magistrate in the station who visited the exhibit and admitted it into evidence &quot;It is clear that the request made by Nang&#39;ea would not be reasonable and in the circumstance would perpetuate the very problem he is complaining of which is a blow to the rule of law because a new magistrate taking up the matter would not have the same advantage. That would not be in the interest of justice,&quot; she said. It is not clear whether Nang&#39;ea, who was visibly troubled when he excused himself from the case on October 26, will take it back or if the defence, which wants Nkaissery, Mwathethe and senior security officials charged with stealing the yacht, will object to Nang&#39;ea&#39;s return.
