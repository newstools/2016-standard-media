A driver at Rongo Sub-County hospital has been arrested in connection with theft of&nbsp;80 litres of fuel. The driver was apprehended by watchmen at the facility&rsquo;s main gate as he was trying to maneuver his way out with the fuel that was meant for the hospital generator. The driver was said to have delivered fuel to the hospital but tactfully kept some of it in the van with the intention of taking it to an unknown destination. As he was driving out, security guards manning the hospital gate moved swiftly after being tipped off by an officer in the facility and asked him where he was taking the 80 litres of fuel in the vehicle but he could not explain. This prompted them to alert the hospital administrator who in turn called the police. smuggle items READ MORE Crisis as medical staff in Murang'a join casual workers in protest Man stabbed to death over suspected love affair Two Nairobi students sit for KCSE in police cells after arrest over robbery with violence &ldquo;Items have been getting lost from the hospital under unclear circumstances and we have been blamed for such losses by those in charge,&rdquo; one guard said, adding that they will be vigilant to arrest any other suspect who may be tempted to smuggle items from the facility. He said they had also realised that some culprits hide the items in Government vehicles by colluding with the drivers. Rongo Officer Commanding Police Division Jonathan Kisaka condemned the incident, saying the suspect will be arraigned in Rongo law court today to face charges of attempting to steal from the hospital.
