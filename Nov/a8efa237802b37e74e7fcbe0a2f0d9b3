A Catholic bishop has barred churches from inviting politicians&nbsp;to fundraisers as guests of honour.Bishop Paul Kariuki&nbsp;also ordered that church facilities, like halls and compounds, should not be used for political gatherings.These are among the measures the diocese has taken to keep the populace focused, so that they can have the best leaders who can lead the country to greater heights. Kariuki said politicians can make their contributions just like any other person.&quot;During Christian funerals and burials, no political campaigns nor speeches should be entertained. Political announcements should not be entertained in the Church during announcement times after mass,&quot; read an Exhortation order signed by Kariuki and which was sent to all priests and Christians in the Diocese.No priest is supposed to be publicly affiliated to a particular political party and he should not campaign for a politician or political party.&quot;Never accept bribes in order that you may vote for the bribe giver. Indeed all those who bribe or give money because they wish to influence people to vote for them are corrupt leaders and should not at all be voted in. True leaders give their manifesto of what they can do to help our county and our country to grow,&quot; he said.He urged the youth to refrain from being used by politicians to cause chaos. The directive has received overwhelming support from locals who said other churches across the country should emulate the diocese.
