Nakuru County Government has ruled out waiving sand charges to a group of traders from Kiambu who are opposed to the levy. &nbsp;The county said the charges were part of their budgeted revenue, adding that they had been gazetted and made into laws. &nbsp;This comes a day after traders under the Bamasutra Savings and Credit Company blocked the Mai Mahiu-Limuru road for over five hours to protest against the charges. The traders said that they had obtained a court order barring the county from collecting royalties from sand. -Antony Gitonga
