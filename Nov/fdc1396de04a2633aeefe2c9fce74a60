Ford-Kenya now wants elective posts shared democratically among CORD partners where they enjoy support. Party leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula said his party was banking on reciprocation from partner parties as it prepared for the August 8 General Election. &quot;For example, both Nairobi and Mombasa cities are two major cosmopolitan regions. We expect CORD parties to share the spoils equally,&quot; he said. And Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, who is also Ford-Kenya&#39;s deputy party leader, said his party was ready to back Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar to become Mombasa&#39;s governor next year if the Wiper Democratic Movement supported Ford-Kenya&#39;s senatorial candidate Yassir Bajaber. Mr Wetang&#39;ula, who was addressing party supporters at Koblenz Hall in Mombasa County yesterday, said the party would not be presenting a candidate for the Mombasa governorship but had its eyes focused on the senator&#39;s seat. &quot;We have earmarked Yassir Bajaber for the senator&#39;s post and expect the other CORD partner parties to respect our wishes and support us as we shall also reciprocate with the other elective posts that partner parties might be interested in,&quot; he added.
