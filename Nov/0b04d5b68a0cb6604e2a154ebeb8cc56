The family of a woman arrested on claims of spreading rumours on closure of Family Bank has come out to defend her. The family claimed Christine Njeri from Ngong had voluntarily informed the bank of the message, which apparently contained her number as the reference contact. The message alleged the bank was set to be closed by the Central Bank of Kenya over its implication in the Sh791 million National Youth Service scandal. The message was also allegedly compelling all the 1.7 million customers of the bank to withdraw their cash before the bank goes under. According to her sister Elizabeth Wambui, Ms Njeri started receiving random calls on Tuesday from Family Bank customers who wanted to know more about the purported closure. On Friday at 5pm, Njeri was summoned to appear at the Ngong AP camp where he found two officials from the bank already waiting.
