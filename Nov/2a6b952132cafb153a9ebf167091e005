Leaders elected on the party&rsquo;s ticket but have not been paying monthly subscription fees will be in trouble and branch officials interested in running must relinquish their positions.The party Wednesday announced those seeking the party&rsquo;s ticket to run for president, governor, senator, Member of Parliament, Woman Representative and Member of County Assembly have until November 30 to file their applications.Party primariesIt becomes the first party to invite applications in preparation for party primaries long before the official nomination period that is 90 days to the August 8, 2017 poll.Wednesday, the National Elections Board (NEB) spelt out conditions for one to qualify for consideration.Anyone who wants to vie for presidency will part with a non-refundable fee of Sh1 million.The party&rsquo;s top organ has since endorsed party leader, Raila, to run for President but he is still in talks with fellow opposition leaders Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetangula to field a joint presidential candidate for CORD.Aspirants for governor will pay Sh500,000 which is Sh200,000 more compared to 2013. For senators and MPs the fee is Sh250,000, Sh100,000 for women MPs and Sh25,000 for MCAs.&ldquo;But for all persons from vulnerable groups, youth women and persons living with disabilities, they will be required just to pay half the set amounts,&rdquo; said NEB chairperson Judith Pareno.Special interest groups in the county assembly will pay Sh15,000.NEB said the nomination exercise will be open exclusively to members of the party.And this is not just by the virtue of one&rsquo;s name being in the register but also remitting the party&rsquo;s annual or monthly fees.&ldquo;There is nothing like being a member by affiliation or just because majority of your area people are from ODM. No one will participate in the nomination process if his or her name does not appear in the register,&rdquo; said ODM executive director Oduor Ongwen.Opening up the tendering process Wednesday, Ms Pareno said interested applicants have up to November 30 to submit their applications.However, the deadline for civil servants will stretch up to February next year, &lsquo;&rsquo;but they will be required to submit an expression of interest pending their resignation as per the election laws.&rdquo;It is after receiving the applications that the NEB will form constitution and county election boards to vet the applications which she insisted will be open and as per the set out guidelines of the party.Increase transparencyPareno said the nominations, which party leader has promised they will be free and fair, will be carried out in zones across all the 34,000 polling stations.This, she said, is because they are moving away from making it a one-day exercise to increase transparency.&ldquo;And we also receive many applications, at times over 20 per position which all have to be vetted for nominations,&rdquo; said Pareno.However, an earlier National Governing Council of the party had endorsed Raila for the presidency.&ldquo;That is still a matter under negotiations. It is not done until it is done. We still have a National Delegates Conference that will have the final say,&rdquo; said Mr Ongwen.Sounding a warning to all grassroots party officials, Pareno said none of them should transact business with an aspirant regarding nominations. That they should not mislead aspirants that they will give them a certificate.
