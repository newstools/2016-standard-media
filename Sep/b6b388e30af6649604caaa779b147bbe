Many women in active politics in the Rift Valley region have expressed interest in the competitive governor and senator positions.This is in stark contrast to the last elections where they crowded for the constitutionally created post of county woman representative. The Constitution gave women a boost following the formation of women representative slots that saw them compete for the 47 positions across the country; it was a females-only battle.With the present political activities in the region, the narrative is likely to change as women brave the murky waters of titanic competition against their male counterparts to be the next senators, governors and county assembly members.Stacey Chepkemoi, 23, believed to be the youngest Senate contender for Bomet, will be running against political heavyweights including the incumbent, Wilson Lesan.Ms Chepkemoi, who is also the Chief Executive Officer for Chemaluk Enterprise and the Bomet youth president, believes that anyone has a chance to represent the electorate at any level irrespective of gender.Her interest in the male dominated seats is driven by a desire to transform agriculture in her region along with ensuring that the youth docket is fully devolved so that youths can benefit from job opportunities and empowerment.&ldquo;I am fully in the race and my aim is to ensure that policies are in place to propel equal representation for both women and youths,&rdquo; she noted.&ldquo;I also want to fight for the reversal of the growing wage bill and prove to my male counterparts that women can do better in leadership and they should be elected, not just nominated.&rdquo;In Nandi County, Yulita Mitei, a lecturer at the University of Eldoret, is contesting for the governorship in a crowded race that has attracted bigwigs including former cabinet ministers Felix Koskei and Henry Kosgei. They are also facing the incumbent, Cleophas Lagat.Better managersHer mission is to send a message that women are better managers and leaders than men, and they should not be discriminated against or intimidated.Dr Mitei maintained that leadership was not about muscle but, more importantly, wisdom.&ldquo;In the past, we have seen Rift Valley women take key positions like former cabinet ministers Sally Kosgei and Margaret Kamar. As new entrants, we are ready to provide services to the public and transform their lives,&rdquo; she stated.&ldquo;We should be given equal chances just like the men because we are all guided by the Constitution that values fairness.&rdquo;Mitei, 46, who comes from Katanin village in Ndalat ward, says the agriculture-rich region has not been able to receive adequate funds meant to transform it.Victorine Jepkorir Kapkiai, 38, is another woman ready to battle it out for the Uasin Gishu Senate seat come the 2017 elections.She comes on board with skills in finance as a PhD finalist and part-time lecturer at Moi University. Her mission, she says, is to improve the representation of the locals and ensure equitable sharing of resources as she looks at ways to fight unemployment.Her focus will also be on ensuring farmers&rsquo; concerns regarding prices and inputs are well addressed.&ldquo;As women, we have a right to contest any seat and as a candidate, I want to ensure increased funding and that the young and the old are given attention,&rdquo; said Dr Kipkiai.She explained that most women have shied away from the race because of fear of victimisation from their male counterparts.She added that most women in the region had for a long time been confined to household chores.&ldquo;We are confident that we shall give the men a run for their money because ultimately, the locals will determine who to vote for,&rdquo; said Kipkiai.Good roadsRael Rugut, 37, is the only female candidate who has declared an interest in the Uasin Gishu governorship.The mother of three who comes from Cheptiret, Kesses constituency, wants to champion for good roads and improved agriculture along with health, which she insists has not been fully addressed by the sitting governor.&ldquo;I have been working in Juba in South Sudan and I have gained vast experience in relations, which I believe will assist me in getting to know what is best for the public. All regions must be heard irrespective of tribe,&rdquo; she said.She believes in empowering the youth and women.
