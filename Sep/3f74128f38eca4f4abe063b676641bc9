Old healthcare providers would rather pray for HIV positive adolescents rather than counsel them, a new survey has shown.This coupled with teachers who are not conversant with how to handle HIV positive students have made it difficult for some 75,600 adolescents to access Anti-retroviral (ARVs) drugs.The survey by Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) has revealed that this category of service providers is judgemental and not understanding, as some criticise the adolescents for their &#39;ungodly&#39; sexual behaviour. &quot;Adolescent girls and young women living with HIV continue to face hostile, judgemental or insensitive attitudes by providers who feel they should not be engaging in sex because of their status,&quot; reads the survey that was also commissioned by the National Empowerment Network of People living with HIV and AIDS in Kenya (Nephak) and Sauti Skika.The survey recommended up-scaling of free (affordable) youth-friendly services desegregated by age in Government facilities with trained younger service providers who are more sensitive to their (adolescents&#39;) sexual and reproductive needs and concerns.Presenting the survey yesterday, Human rights lawyer Melba Katindi contracted by Nephak, noted that most adolescents polled preferred younger service providers.&quot;The old folks would start probing you on why you engage in such behaviours or even opt to pray for you when all you needed was someone to talk to; someone who understands,&quot; said Katindi.The survey also revealed that most teachers are not well trained to handle students living with the virus. This, therefore, makes it difficult for such students to access treatment as they fear asking for permission to attend clinic. Asking for permission means they will be forced to disclose their ailment.&quot;Unauthorised disclosure in learning institutions serves to enhance the high level of stigma resulting in poor performance, absenteeism transfers and even school drop outs,&quot; reads the survey.It involved a discussion with HIV positive adolescents and young women.
