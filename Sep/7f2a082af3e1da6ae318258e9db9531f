NAIROBI, KENYA: Telkom Kenya has reviewed its data offers for its pre-paid Internet on Mobile and Internet Everywhere (modem) customers.&nbsp; At a browsing rate of 9 cents per MB, the new volume-based data offers are a first of their kind in the market; offering a wider range of validity periods, giving the customer power to choose between daily, weekly, monthly and ninety day options. &nbsp;Telkom Kenya Chief Corporate Communications Officer George Mlaghui says that the new data offer speaks of the business&rsquo; proactive approach to meeting the needs of the market. &nbsp;&ldquo;Telkom Kenya seeks to provide value to our customers through our service and offerings,&rdquo; says Mlaghui.&nbsp;An additional benefit is the introduction of notification on expiry of data bundles 48 hours and 24 hours before the expiry of the bundles. This allows the customer to make an informed decision to either top up and purchase additional bundles or continue browsing at the Pay As You Go rate of Sh 4 per MB. Customers can be able to extend the expiry periods of data bundles before they expire by purchasing another bundle of equal or higher validity before the expiry of their current bundle.&nbsp;
