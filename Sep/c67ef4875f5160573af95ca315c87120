Counties have received Sh900 million from the Government towards the free maternity programme.Confirming the release Thursday, Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri said the amount was the first quarter disbursement for the financial year 2016/17. It also followed President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s directive to have the funds disbursed earlier than usual to cushion the counties from stretching their budgets in catering for the free services.Of the 47 counties, Nakuru, Kiambu, Kakamega, Nairobi, and Bungoma were the biggest beneficiaries, courtesy of their big delivery numbers.With 10,881 deliveries, Nakuru has been allocated Sh50 million, Kiambu (9,606) Sh45 million, Kakamega (10,072) Sh39 million, Nairobi (7,600) Sh36 million, Bungoma (8,573) Sh34 million and Kisii (7,593) Sh31 million.Others are Migori (7,885) Sh28 million, Kisumu (5,439) Sh25 million, Homabay (5,956) Sh23 million, Meru (4,786) Sh22 million and Mombasa (4,433) Sh21 million.However, the country&#39;s referral hospitals will be receiving the biggest chunk of the Sh900 million allocations.Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) has been allocated Sh78 million from the 4,474 deliveries with the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital receiving Sh61 million from 3,523 deliveries.Counties of Lamu (632), Samburu (828), Marsabit (1,112) and Turkana (1,455) are among those that got the least having being allocated Sh2.6 million, Sh3 million, Sh4.2 million and Sh5.6 million respectively.&quot;As a Government, we are committed to ensuring that pregnant women and their children receive the quality health care they deserve,&quot; said Dr Muraguri.In August, the PS announced proposals that would have seen the funds disbursed through the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF).
