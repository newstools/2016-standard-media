Nearly all of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s former lieutenants who were relieved of their duties are now intending to run for governor&rsquo;s seats.And following the launch of the Jubilee Party last Saturday, the former Cabinet Secretaries are now busy launching and pushing for a major comeback into leadership as people&rsquo;s representatives. Former CSs Anne Waiguru (Devolution), Francis Kimemia (Secretary to the Cabinet ), Kazungu Kambi (Labour), Felix Koskei (Agriculture), Charity Ngilu (Lands) and Joseph ole Lenku (Interior) have declared interest in governor&rsquo;s positions and are already making glitzy appearances in their counties.Waiguru, Kimemia, Koskei and Lenku were part of the delegates at last weekend&rsquo;s Jubilee Party launch at Kasarani where 13 parties dissolved to join the new vehicle that President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto will use to seek re-election.On Friday, Waiguru, the latest entrant among the six, was endorsed by elders in Kutus town, Kirinyaga County, where she has declared her interest to unseat incumbent Joseph Ndathi.Her colleagues Kimemia, Kambi, Lenku and Koskei started off their forays at the counties earlier and are currently giving the incumbents a run for their money.Their comeback is expected to cause political excitement in their respective counties, given their stature, clout and experience in the Government.Kambi and Ngilu were politicians before they joined the Cabinet in 2013, but the rest of the aspirants are getting into the murky waters after careers at the private sector and the government.But issues of integrity, especially on Waiguru, Kimemia, Koskei, Kambi and Ngilu that led to their exit from their ministerial positions, will likely emerge and could be used by their opponents.Apart from Lenku, the five CSs were hounded out of office through allegations of corruption, majority falling with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission report read in Parliament by President Kenyatta.Uhuru directed all government officials mentioned in the EACC report to step aside to allow investigations into allegations against them.But they insisted the allegations were tramped up and they have since been cleared.Kimemia said he had been cleared of any wrongdoing and the EACC had written to the Director of Public Prosecutions early last year to close his file.He had been mentioned in connection with irregularities in awarding of a tender worth Sh1 billion at the Interior ministry, but according to him, the allegations were &ldquo;nonsensical&rdquo; because he had not joined the Interior ministry when he was accused of having embezzled the money.EACC had accused him of misappropriating Sh1 billion in 2006 when he was Internal Security Permanent Secretary. The anti-graft body later cleared him of the allegations.Long experience&ldquo;I am a clean man and have trained my eyes on the Nyandarua governor&rsquo;s seat. I would like to serve my people and use my long experience in the civil service to improve the lives of residents of county number 18,&rdquo; said Kimemia, who plans to unseat Governor Daniel Waithaka.Kambi shares Kimemia&rsquo;s sentiments and accuses the EACC of being used as gun for hire just to fight him and some of his colleagues.&ldquo;What integrity issues are you talking about? I was hounded out of office because I appointed some directors in the board of NSSF and some people, who were not amused, started fighting me immediately,&rdquo; said Kambi.He said he has been cleared and is now serving as the chairman of the National Government Constituency Development Fund, as he awaits to snatch the Kilifi governor&rsquo;s seat from ODM&rsquo;s Amazon Kingi.Kambi said he is scheduled to graduate with a Master&rsquo;s degree on Strategic Management from Baraton University. He said his track record in Parliament and as a CS will help him win the governor&rsquo;s seat next year.&ldquo;When I served both as MP and Cabinet Secretary, I served all residents of Kilifi and many approached me to contest. I have heeded to their request and I&rsquo;m ready to lead from the front,&rdquo; said Kambi, who hosted hundreds of people in his Kinarani home as part of his attempt to challenge Kingi.The seat has also attracted Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro, who defected from ODM to Jubilee Party on Saturday. Waiguru, who left office over graft allegations in the National Youth Service (NYS), told The Standard on Sunday that she was ready to face off with Ndathi for Kirinyaga, in a race that could also bring in Kenyan Ambassador to US Njeru Githae.Waiguru said having served at different positions in the civil service, including being a CS, she was prepared for the county&rsquo;s top job.&ldquo;When you work in government, it gives you the experience that makes it easy for you to deliver as a governor, particularly for me who has worked in the Devolution ministry. I am better prepared for the job if elected,&rdquo; she said.She said she did not have integrity issues and was responding to several requests from residents of his county to use her experience to serve them.&ldquo;I have yielded to people&rsquo;s requests, the elders have given me their blessings and I am now ready for politics. My time in the ministry and civil service gives me an edge and I am prepared to serve my people and give them the best,&rdquo; said Waiguru.Not new in the political arena, Ngilu is a maverick politician who had served as MP for Kitui Central for 20years before she lost the senatorial seat to David Musila in the 2013 General Election.She has trained her focus on Kitui Governor Julius Malombe&rsquo;s seat and will also have to square it out with Wiper Chairman David Musila who has also declared interest.Immediately after being named in the EACC list, Ngilu, who is not new to controversy, threatened to name people who were behind her planned downfall.&nbsp;Koskei, who intends to unseat Nandi Governor Cleophas Lagat, was accused of illegally allocating sugar import permits to a selected group of people and allowing improper cultivation of 100-acre piece of government land.Lack of evidenceThe EACC later cleared him of the two allegations for lack of sufficient evidence on the sugar deal and being blameless over land allegation.&ldquo;I was cleared and do not have any integrity issues. I am ready to serve the country in whatever capacity and for now my eyes are on the Nandi governor&rsquo;s seat,&rdquo; said Koskei.Lenku has not been left behind. He will be battling for the Kajiado governor&rsquo;s post.Lenku, who declared his interest for the seat early in the year, said he wanted to save his county from bad leadership that had stagnated development.&ldquo;Our people need good leadership and I am prepared to offer that with passion and dedication,&rdquo; said ole Lenku who will battle it out with Governor David Nkedianye of ODM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s former lieutenants who were relieved of their duties are now intending to run for governor&rsquo;s seats.And following the launch of the Jubilee Party last Saturday, the former Cabinet Secretaries are now busy launching and pushing for a major comeback into leadership as people&rsquo;s representatives.Former CSs Anne Waiguru (Devolution), Francis Kimemia (Secretary to the Cabinet ), Kazungu Kambi (Labour), Felix Koskei (Agriculture), Charity Ngilu (Lands) and Joseph ole Lenku (Interior) have declared interest in governor&rsquo;s positions and are already making glitzy appearances in their counties.Waiguru, Kimemia, Koskei and Lenku were part of the delegates at last weekend&rsquo;s Jubilee Party launch at Kasarani where 13 parties dissolved to join the new vehicle that President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto will use to seek re-election.On Friday, Waiguru, the latest entrant among the six, was endorsed by elders in Kutus town, Kirinyaga County, where she has declared her interest to unseat incumbent Joseph Ndathi.Her colleagues Kimemia, Kambi, Lenku and Koskei started off their forays at the counties earlier and are currently giving the incumbents a run for their money.Their comeback is expected to cause political excitement in their respective counties, given their stature, clout and experience in the Government.Kambi and Ngilu were politicians before they joined the Cabinet in 2013, but the rest of the aspirants are getting into the murky waters after careers at the private sector and the government.But issues of integrity, especially on Waiguru, Kimemia, Koskei, Kambi and Ngilu that led to their exit from their ministerial positions, will likely emerge and could be used by their opponents.Apart from Lenku, the five CSs were hounded out of office through allegations of corruption, majority falling with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission report read in Parliament by President Kenyatta.Uhuru directed all government officials mentioned in the EACC report to step aside to allow investigations into allegations against them.But they insisted the allegations were tramped up and they have since been cleared.Kimemia said he had been cleared of any wrongdoing and the EACC had written to the Director of Public Prosecutions early last year to close his file.He had been mentioned in connection with irregularities in awarding of a tender worth Sh1 billion at the Interior ministry, but according to him, the allegations were &ldquo;nonsensical&rdquo; because he had not joined the Interior ministry when he was accused of having embezzled the money.EACC had accused him of misappropriating Sh1 billion in 2006 when he was Internal Security Permanent Secretary.
