NAIROBI, KENYA: A special parliamentary siting has been scheduled for Tuesday to see Kenya ratify the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) on time.Ahead of the September 30 dead line, Parliamentary Committee on Trade, Planning and Finance has urged fellow parliamentarians to see that the European Union EPA agreement is ratified on Tuesday. &quot;Kenya has already been put on notice by the EU to ratify the EPA before October 1 or else we lose the Duty Free Quota Free EU market access which will attract heavy taxes on our exports,&quot; said the committee chair Benjamin Langat (Ainamoi).This means Kenya will be removed from the preferential list and put on general systems which will make all exports to the EU market attract tax of between five and 22 per cent. The preferential market access was extended for Kenya in December 2014 on condition that Kenya will have signed and ratified the EPA by October 1.Kenya and Rwanda signed the agreement on September 1 but as the constitution demands the agreement (being an international law) has to be ratified before it becomes active.&quot;In the unlikely event that Kenya does not ratify the EPA, it is estimated that over 70 percent of Kenya&#39;s exports to EU stand to be lost. These are mainly flowers, tea, coffee and groceries that account for 22 per cent of Kenya&#39;s total exports,&quot; said Langat.Also, some Sh200 billion investment and four million jobs will be lost.
