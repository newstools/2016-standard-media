Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi&nbsp;is warning that wrangles witnessed&nbsp;in Jubilee strongholds pose a real&nbsp;threat to the survival of the new&nbsp;party. Kiraitu, a former JP National&nbsp;Steering Committee co-chair, has&nbsp;warned that the wrangles could&nbsp;cause internal hemorrhage with&nbsp;disastrous consequences at a time&nbsp;that &ldquo;our party needs to be welcoming members from the opposition&rdquo;.&ldquo;We have the opportunity to&nbsp;completely vanquish the opposition&nbsp;and come out as a strong national&nbsp;party that would bring about&nbsp;the unity that Kenyans are yearning&nbsp;for. But we have to ensure harmony&nbsp;across the branches of the party,&rdquo; says Kiraitu. Wrangles and political machinations in Jubilee Party strongholds have been blamed on a leadership vacuum at the top.Barely two weeks after President Uhuru Kenyatta launched JP, Mount Kenya leaders are engaged in vicious political battles to control the party.In Rift Valley, there is little excitement about the new party apart from the factions that emerged in areas like Nakuru before delegates headed to Nairobi on September 8 for JP&rsquo;s launch.Nandi Senator Stephen Sang said Rift Valley was waiting for the national officials to be unveiled before they pick interim officials at the counties.&ldquo;Once we have the county officials, we will then start mass recruitment of members. That (national officials) is what we are waiting for,&rdquo; Sang said.But this is in complete contrast to what is happening in Mt Kenya region. There is a rush by aspirants to arbitrarily open JP offices and declare themselves party officials in a bid to secure Jubilee tickets.And this is why former JP National Steering Committee co-chair and Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi, is not mincing his words about the dangers of internal wrangles.He is cautioning that the wrangles could cause internal hemorrhage with disastrous consequences at a time that &ldquo;our party needs to be welcoming members from the Opposition.&rdquo;Public confrontation in Embu between Senator Lenny Kivuti and Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and the clash in Murang&rsquo;a, where Kandara MP Alice Wahome and four aspirants seeking to unseat her in the next polls opened two parallel party offices a few metres from each other, set a worrying trend in the party.&ldquo;It is a matter of make or break and Kenyans will soon witness vicious battles in a political contest that could tear the new party apart,&rdquo; said a senior party official in Nyeri who declined to be named.Kiraitu said that there was need to manage the party&rsquo;s affairs well so that &ldquo;the popularity that spread like wild fire across the country is harnessed and put into good use.&rdquo;Party branches&ldquo;We have the opportunity to completely vanquish the Opposition and come out as a strong national party that will bring about the unity that Kenyans are yearning for. But we have to ensure harmony across the branches of the party,&rdquo; Kiraitu said.The Meru Senator said he has been receiving calls from party leaders asking him when the party will unveil officials, adding that there was need to ensure there is no vacuum. &ldquo;Many people believe that I know the list and who is there, but those are malicious rumours. I am among those waiting for the two principals to read the list so that the national officials can move with speed and install party leaders in the counties,&rdquo; he said. He said expectations were high that the President and his deputy William Ruto would unveil the list of party leaders during the launch. Kiraitu disclosed that a section of key party leaders advised the principals not to unveil the list during the launch due to intense lobbying and heated environment.&ldquo;In the run up to the three-day National Delegates Convention and during the event, some officials from the parties that were merging had demanded certain positions making it difficult to arrive at an agreed list,&rdquo; Kiraitu said.He revealed that the President and his deputy were still working on a list that will ensure all the parties are rewarded.&ldquo;The two principals are working on the list that will have the face of Kenya and the delay has been occasioned by the absence of DP who must consult with the President on the final list. They will soon release the list,&rdquo; he said.On wrangles in JP strongholds he warned that &ldquo;they could claw back the gains and goodwill of the party.&rdquo;He announced that after the successful launch of JP on September 10, the party&rsquo;s popularity has been growing across the country and causing ripples in Opposition strongholds. Political analyst Barack Muluka said wrangles in JP strongholds were just a tip of the iceberg, predicting that more fierce political clashes were likely to be witnessed in the coming days and towards the elections.&ldquo;Initially, when people were in different parties there would be alternatives, now there is nowhere to vent; the duel is going to be vicious and more bruising and this is what the architects did not factor in when they thought of vying,&rdquo; Mr Muluka said. He said merging of the parties enured that the new party would take the good and the bad in the political units and the reality was now hitting home.&ldquo;The makers of the merged party forgot that some times people live on hope and it is that hope that keeps them going even after losing an election.&ldquo;Now the same politicians are being told that &lsquo;you either make it or vanquish&rsquo;; they will become extremely aggressive and this will be worse as we get near the elections,&rdquo; Mr Muluka said.
