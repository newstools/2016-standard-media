Private universities have faulted a study which claims that students who graduate from their institutions are not preferred by employers.The National Association of Private Universities in Kenya (NAPUK) termed the report commissioned by the British Council as &lsquo;misleading&rsquo;. &ldquo;There has never been a true record detailing the number of private university graduates denied opportunities in either public or private sector,&rdquo; Vincent Gaitho, NAPUK secretary general said.Dr Gaitho, who teaches at Catholic University of East Africa, questioned the government&rsquo;s motive in sponsoring 12,000 students to private universities if the institutions have &lsquo;questionable contribution in job market&rsquo;.He also questioned the timing of the release of the report terming it &lsquo;malicious and lacking facts.&rsquo; The study was conducted in March 2013 and February 2016 in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana.&ldquo;Why would such study findings be released just when private universities are admitting government-sponsored students? Are public universities scared of having a level playing ground on education?&rdquo; posed Dr Gaitho.The study lists top public universities as dominating the top 10 list of institutions whose graduates are preferred by employers.The top three universities are University of Nairobi, Kenyatta and Moi University.NAPUK deputy chairperson, Ken Mbiuki, said the report is &lsquo;a slap in the face&rsquo; of the efforts by private institutions to support government achieve its development agenda.&ldquo;The report is not a true reflection of reality. Private universities have been producing graduates for a long time and the students get employed. Where is the data with contrary details?&rdquo; posed Mbiuki, who is also the founder of Zetech University.President Uhuru Kenyatta instructed the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS) to place students in private universities under government sponsorship.This is the first time the government will pay tuition fees for students admitted in private universities. According to KUCCPS data, the Thika-based Mount Kenya University got the largest share of students &mdash;1,580.Catholic University of East Africa was allocated the second highest (1,182), while Zetech University got 635 and KCA University 405 students. Kenya Highlands Evangelical University received 533 students, Africa Nazarene 333 and Baraton 570 students.
