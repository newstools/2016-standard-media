NAIROBI: Since Al Shabaab militants kidnapped two tourists in Lamu and killed another in October 2011, Kenya&rsquo;s military expenditure has ballooned. The country is now the seventh-largest spender across all of Africa.And since 2005, Kenya has spent a cumulative $8.8 billion (Sh884billion) on military hardware and operations, making it the fifth-highest spender in sub-Saharan Africa, which excludes North African nations.Recent data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) indicates that Kenya has beefed up resource allocations to its military, with the largest spikes recorded in the last five years.These findings come just as the country prepares to mark three years tomorrow since men armed with assault rifles and grenades stormed the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.What was first thought to be a robbery turned into a four-day stand-off between the men, later identified as Al Shabaab militants, and Kenya&rsquo;s police and military forces.At the end of it, more than 60 people were killed, dozens injured, and the mall was reduced to a bullet-riddled, smoldering shell that was boarded up for two years. It reopened last July, and has since got back to 100 per cent occupancy.Terrorist attacksWith more than Sh7.8 billion worth of property destroyed, the Financial Times placed the Westgate siege among the top 20 most expensive terrorist attacks from an insurance perspective.The Somali militant group said its members staged the attack to protest the presence of Kenya&rsquo;s army in Somalia.In October 2011, former President Mwai Kibaki announced that the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) had launched an operation in Somalia to pursue suspected Al Shabaab terrorists, following the attacks on tourists in the resort town of Lamu.KDF personnel during the Mashujaa Day 2015 celebrations at Nyayo National Stadium, Nairobi.

After Operation Linda Nchi, this increased more than 10 times over.Kenya&rsquo;s key source markets, led by the US, Britain, France and Austria, have issued travel advisories to their citizens in the wake of the increasing terror attacks, leading to the worst slump in the tourism sector since the 2007-08 post-election violence.From 1.8 million tourist arrivals in 2011, this number dropped to 1.1 million last year, with billions of shillings in lost revenue and more than 25,000 layoffs, particularly in the coastal region.Paul Collier, a professor of economics and public policy at Oxford University, notes that military expenditure is very costly for developing countries and hurts development.&ldquo;Developing countries have enough problems without either the waste of resources constituted by military expenditure, or the social and economic destruction brought about by warfare,&rdquo; Prof Collier argues in a paper titled &lsquo;War and Military Expenditure in Developing Countries and Their Consequences for Development&rsquo;.Collier added that military expenditure not only diverts government resources that could be used to improve public services, infrastructure or lower taxes, it also leads to an arms race.&ldquo;To the extent that a past war raises military expenditure because of a perceived higher risk of further war, it reflects fear of neighbours, or aggressive intentions towards them,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Each time one country raises its military expenditure, there will be a ripple effect across the region. Further, as neighbours respond to the initial increase, the country that increased its military expenditure may itself respond with further increases &ndash; the classic process of an arms race.&rdquo;Should this scenario play out in Kenya, taxpayers could be in for a punishing regional race. Already, early this year SIPRI reported Kenya is set to acquire a Sh1 billion military drone from the US government.Further, the Government is yet to outlay an exit strategy for the military operation in Somalia, even as another deployment of KDF soldiers into South Sudan looms, following a UN Security Council recommendation last month.fsunday@standardmedia.co.ke
