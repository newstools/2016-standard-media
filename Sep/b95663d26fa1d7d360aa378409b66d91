While the suspects escaped, police recovered an arms cache that included a G-3 rifle and an M-4 rifle, both stolen from slain police officers.They also recovered 345 rounds of ammunition, 15 phones and a laptop.Another tip from the public led the police to a Malindi residence on January 20, 2016.The occupants were believed to have been the same suspects that escaped from the Majengo house and were close associates of Soshi.Following a shoot-out with police, four suspects were gunned down and one police officer was injured.The house in which the suspect was shot yesterday is about 500m from where British terror suspect Jermaine Grant was captured about five years ago.According to police, Soshi had links with Harun Fazul, an Al Qaeda operative who was killed in Somalia in 2011, and the Jaysh Ayman militant group said to be behind the low-level insurgency in Boni Forest, Lamu County.Mr Ngatia said the suspect was killed inside the house of Fatuma Mohamed Masuo, the widow of Kassim Omolo, an alleged terrorist killed by police on June 17, 2013, in Mlaleo, Kisauni.Kisauni OCPD Richard Ngatia inside the room where suspected terrorist Ismail Mohamed Soshi (above) was killed yesterday.
