Classic Mouldings Limited has signed a partnership with the Kisumu county government that will see the interior design firm offer free training to 1,000 artisans.Classic Mouldings will launch its Professional Applicators Club (PAC), in support of the Kisumu community development efforts. The partnership was signed by Governor Jack Ranguma in the presence of Communication and ICT Executive Michael Onyango. The PAC training programme will promote local entrepreneurs, and help young people through building decorative painting skills and interior design abilities.In the past three years, PAC has trained more than 5,000 young people in Mombasa, Nairobi and Eldoret creating a pool of professional artisans servicing the booming real estate sector in the country.&ldquo;This training has changed lives. These young people we have trained at PAC have moved from being jobless to being job creators, employing hundreds of others in this country.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are very passionate about impacting the lives of these beneficiaries, creating professionals for the industry, who will then grow our economy, empower their communities and create a reliable livelihood for themselves and their families,&rdquo; said Classic Mouldings CEO Moshe Noiman after signing the partnership.After the artisans have gained technical skills from PAC, they will also benefit from entrepreneurial training to professionalise their skills so that they can develop and manage them into their own viable businesses.&ldquo;Our people have salient artistic talents in their DNA, and together with the proprietary techniques that Classic Mouldings trainers are bringing on board, am looking forward to putting into the work place, what will possibly be some of the world&rsquo;s most talented painters/interior decorators,&rdquo; Ranguma said.
