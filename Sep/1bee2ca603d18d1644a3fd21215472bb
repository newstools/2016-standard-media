Residents of Kilgoris in Narok County have benefited from a free medical camp courtesy of Safaricom Foundation and The Kenya Diabetes Management and Information Centre (KDMIC).KDMIC Executive Director Eva Muchemi said for a community that is constantly on the move due to its nomadic nature, access to medical care has been a challenge, leaving them exposed to a myriad of diseases. &ldquo;Kenya Diabetes Management Information Centre has been working closely with the Safaricom Foundation since 2006 to reach needy communities with free medical services and we are proud of the impact so far&rdquo; said Health Co-ordinator at KDMIC Joseph Mwangi.&ldquo;It was important for us to come, treat and educate the community on diabetes and other non-communicable diseases,&rdquo; added Mr Mwangi.
