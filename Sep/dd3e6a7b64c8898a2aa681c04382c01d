Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) has announced commencement of bids for the construction of modular geothermal power plants at Olkaria. According to KenGen, the construction of the plant will reduce over reliance on hydroelectric power generation.The new system will also cut the costs of generation. Modular power plant will generate power using a well head generator that will tap steam from the geothermal wells. Unlike permanent power plants which take up to 36 months to construct, the new technology, according to KenGen, will only take six months, therefore ensuring a quick return on investment. The use of mobile well heads to generate power was first introduced in the country in 2014 and targeted production of 5MegaWatts (MW) of electricity. &mdash;Mumbi Kinyua
