Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes where one&rsquo;s eye blood vessels are damaged and either stop functioning or grow abnormally. It can affect people with both type one and type two diabetes and is one of the leading causes of blindness.There are two types of this disease &mdash; early diabetic retinopathy and advanced diabetic retinopathy. In the former, walls of the tiny blood vessels in the retina weaken, start leaking fluid and blood into the retina. In the latter, the damaged blood vessels close off, prompting growth of new but abnormal blood vessels which leak blood. However, despite diabetic retinopathy&rsquo;s severity, the condition can be prevented especially by controlling blood sugar levels and early diabetic retinopathy is actually reversible if this is done.Too much sugar in the blood can lead to weakening or blockage of blood vessels that nourish the retina. It is, therefore, important that one manage their sugar levels as key to preventing diabetic retinopathy.Regular and scheduled eye check-ups are also very essential. It is recommended to check your eyes every year just to track any changes in vision and eye health.Check and control of blood pressure is recommended too. Diabetics who also have high blood pressure are at higher risk of this disease because the high blood pressure adds strain onto the already weak vessels, increasing progression of the condition.Eating a low cholesterol diet which is rich in antioxidants and other eye-friendly nutrients such as omega 3 fatty acids will also help keep this illness away.
