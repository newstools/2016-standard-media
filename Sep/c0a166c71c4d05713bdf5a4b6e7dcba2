Kenya Power is in the process of implementing a Sh13 billion underground power network project in Nairobi. The cabling project is expected to improve the quality of electricity supply in the capital.The project will reinforce the Nairobi City Centre bulk power supply system by providing alternative supply to the existing substations.&ldquo;The project entails installation of underground cables around the city to eliminate interruptions that often result from interference with the overhead cables,&rdquo; said Kenya Power Chief Executive Ben Chumo during a press briefing at Stima Plaza.&ldquo;This is envisaged to improve supply quality to our customers around Nairobi,&rdquo; he added.About 30.71km of 66kV transmission lines in underground cables connected to the new substation, wchich will be set up in the city centre, will be installed.This will provide a link between the new substation and six other existing substations around the city to expand the distribution network and reduce system losses. In addition to the city centre substations, the project will also involve construction of two other substations.&ldquo;The underground cabling technology is more aesthetic compared to overhead lines and less expensive in terms of land acquisition challenges and wayleaves requirement,&rdquo; said Mr Chumo.Through the underground cables, the power supplier targets to reach new customers, who will be connected to power in the ongoing government electrification programmes.Mr Chumo said the power utility firm&rsquo;s customer base increased from 2.3 million customers to five million customers between June 2013 and September this year, a situation that necessitated the investment in underground cabling.Besides the underground cabling, the power supplier has also upgraded 81 substations and built 11,718km of medium voltage lines to expand its distribution network between the same period.ConcessionThe underground cabling project is being implemented through a concessional 20-year loan, charged at two per cent interest with a grace period of seven years and repayment term of 13 years, from China Exim Bank. It is expected to be completed by the end of July next year.Meanwhile, the power supplier in conjunction with the Nairobi county government yesterday started a project to remove illegal billboards mounted on street lights in the city. The project began on Langata Road.Mr Francis Mwaura, an engineer with the county government, said about Sh25 million is paid for street lighting per month and much of this money goes into servicing illegal connections.&ldquo;These connections also overload streetlights making them go off,&rdquo; Mr Mwaura said.
