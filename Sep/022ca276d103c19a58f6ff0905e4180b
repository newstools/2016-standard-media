The bill proposing to restrict public smoking to between 6pm and 6am has been rubbished by the Tobacco board chairman who termed the proposed amendments as &quot;manufactured ignorance.&quot;If implemented, the bill drafted by Uriri MP John Kobado would see convicted offenders liable to a fine not exceeding Sh100,000 or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.However, Professor Peter Odhiambo, chairman of the Tobacco Control Board (TCB) has said in a statement to newsrooms that there are glaring dangers and weaknesses in the proposed amendments of the Tobacco Control Act and Regulations.&quot;The hours proposed for smoke are a sure recipe for breaking the law on no smoking in public places,&quot; he said. &quot;The home and family cars fall within the scheduled list of Public Places.&quot;He added that a large fraction of the hours between 6pm and 6am are spent at home with family, so the proposal that one may smoke only between those hours would expose spouses and children to second-hand smoking.The bill also proposes to levy sh150 million to be paid by all tobacco manufacturers to a centralised fund in order to share the cost of treating cancer patients and mitigate other destructive effects caused by tobacco.However, Odhiambo said that this fell far short of the much bigger challenge of dealing with the damages caused by the farming, trading and consumption of tobacco. &quot;Without even mentioning profits which the tobacco industry reaps and repatriates from Kenya, the damages of tobacco are enough to consume a huge chunk of the national budget in the effort to offset them,&quot; he said.He sighted food insecurity, environmental and soil degradation, water pollution, mental incapacitation, insecurity and graduation to other drugs in addition to health and rehabilitation issues as some of the effects of tobacco.&quot;The proposed sh150million levy is grossly inadequate to tackle the damages and ills caused by tobacco,&quot; he said.
