But even as they presented a united front, Wanjiru&#39;s supporters heckled Sonko, prompting the senator to ask that they be kicked out of the event.IMPROMPTU TOUROn Monday, in what was seen as an attempt to boost unity among the leaders, Uhuru took it upon himself to make an impromptu tour alongside some of the aspirants.&quot;Whether they pick Margaret Wanjiru, Mike Sonko, Johnson Sakaja or any other candidate for the Jubilee ticket, we will have to respect the people&#39;s decision,&quot; Uhuru said.Duale and Waweru said the aspirants had promised to work together in ensuring that Jubilee unseated Kidero in the general election next year.&quot;All these leaders belong to our party and we believe in internal competition and democracy.
