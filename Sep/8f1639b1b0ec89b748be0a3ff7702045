Poor performance in the personal vehicles and medical insurance segments continues to haunt insurers despite an increase in chronic diseases and more Kenyans buying cars in recent years.Since 2002, general insurance companies have only tasted underwriting profit from private vehicles once. This came in 2011, when this class gave the industry a paltry Sh278.9 million profit. The dismal performance for the industry in this segment has persisted with last year resulting in underwriting loss of Sh3.1 billion, the highest in 14 years.Things have also not been any rosier in the medical covers segment, due to what many insurers say is a rise in fraudulent claims.Profit margins&ldquo;It is true that for a number of companies, profits haven&rsquo;t been coming through. Even when profits come through, the margins are not attractive for this product,&rdquo; said AAR Managing Director Caroline Munene, whose firm also offers medical cover.For six years to December, general insurance companies, when combined, have been incurring losses in this class except for a Sh283 million profit made in 2013.Since 2006 when medical insurance providers were 21, the number had kept growing up to a high of 29 in 2014. However, by last year, this class was covered by 22 service providers.Equally, the number of entities registered as motor assessors dropped by six to 108.The going has been rocky for most insurers. Data compiled from annual reports by IRA since 2002 show that with exception of 2011, the number of insurers making underwriting loss from insuring private vehicles has always exceeded those making profits.In 2010, just nine insurers made profit from private vehicles while a whopping 26 reported losses.&ldquo;In 2011, motor private, which has been recording underwriting losses for the past four years, registered underwriting profit of Sh279 million,&rdquo; said Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) in its 2011 industry report.However, this 129 per cent rise in earnings from this class was short-lived. In 2012, 18 insurers sank into losses against 15 that made profit.But 2013 proved the worst year for motor private underwriters as 27 firms, being 82 per cent of insurers offering this cover, registered losses from this class. Surprisingly, with a Sh693.9 million loss, it was the only class that registered losses that year.&ldquo;Motor private class recorded the largest underwriting loss of Sh1.73 billion by the end of the period under review. Commenting on the 2014 performance, IRA said this may be attributed to high cases of fraud.Last year, company filings compiled by the regulator show that only 10 out of 34 insurers from this class made profit. It was also the year that saw all the three re-insurers record losses from this class.&nbsp;
