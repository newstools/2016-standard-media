Former Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Mwangi Thuita has stirred political waters in Laikipia County by declaring his intention to vie for the governor&#39;s seat.&nbsp;Thuita announced his political debut last week, citing his vast experience in&nbsp; public administration. He served in senior positions in the Government for over 20 years.He is expected to run on a Jubilee Party ticket, further complicating the political equation of the county&#39;s gubernatorial race.Political pundits say the entry of the former PS in the governorship race is a game changer.Thuita joins a growing crowd of candidates, including the incumbent&nbsp; governor, Joshua Irungu, his deputy Gitonga Kabugi, former industrialisation assistant minister Ndiritu Muriithi, former county secretary, John Mwaniki and businessman Mburu Kamau.Before his entry, Governor Irungu and former President Mwai Kibaki&#39;s nephew, Ndiritu Muriithi, were viewed as the front-runners in the race.Not anymore.Thuita&#39;s political advisers and business allies from both Nyahururu and Nanyuki town have been holding strategy meetings to plot the former PS&#39;s political debut.They are telling other contenders to brace themselves for a tough battle.&quot;We have what it takes to give them a run for their money. Already, we have the support of the people,&quot; said Michael Mugo, one of Thuita&#39;s supporters.Pundits say the race will now be a game of tactics.&quot;There are now three senior people in the race, the governor, Ndiritu and now Thuita. Laikipia people should expect a serious political battle,&quot; says political analyst and lawyer Martin Waichungo.Thuita&#39;s political debut, he said, would also divide the votes from the populous Laikipia West.The incumbent governor, Ndiritu, Mburu and Thuita come from the region.Both Irungu and Ndiritu have downplayed Thuita&#39;s political ambitions.&quot;I am ready to face anyone in the race. I am sure that his (Thuita) entry will not change anything,&quot; said Irungu.Ndiritu dismissed Thuita as an outsider in Laikipia politics.&quot;New comers in Laikipia politics will not be allowed to control the people,&quot; he said
