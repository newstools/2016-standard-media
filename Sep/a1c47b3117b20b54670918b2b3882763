General insurance companies suffered a shock underwing loss in more than a decade to put a grip on the industry&rsquo;s earnings as profits slowed by 18 per cent to Sh14.1billion.The latest report by Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) show that 15 out of 36 general insurance companies succumbed to underwriting losses in the financial year ending December 31, 2015. Underwriting loss, which means that premiums collected on insurance policies by the insurers also fell below the expenses incurred and claims paid out, amounted to Sh226.3 million. The loss translates to a 114 per cent drop compared to 2014 when businesses registered Sh1.6 billion profits.This also means that earnings from general insurance have dropped for the second year in a row since touching industry&rsquo;s record high of 3.4 billion in 2013.&ldquo;Motor private class of insurance business reported escalating losses amounting to Sh3.1 billion in the year under review.
