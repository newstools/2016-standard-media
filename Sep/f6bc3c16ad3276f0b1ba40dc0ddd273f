With less than a year to the General Election, the county gubernatorial seat has attracted interest from many quarters.The aspirants want to unseat governor Jackson Mandago who they have accused of unfair distribution of resources and discrimination while hiring. Those eying the seat include Kenya High Commissioner in Islamabad Julius Bitok, Edward Serem who is the Chief Health Officer in Nandi County, Rael Rugut and Justus Misoi, both in business.Mandago beat Bitok in the 2013 polls and observers are predicting that the race will be a two-horse race between them. Bitok has publicly declared his interest in the race and is only waiting for the start of the official campaign period.&ldquo;Elections are still far and at the moment, I am positioning myself even as I watch the political trends in the region. The county deserves a leader who will provide equitable services to the electorate,&rdquo; Bitok said.COMPLETE PROJECTSHe was appointed envoy by President Uhuru Kenyatta after losing the 2013 gubernatorial race.Mandago told The Standard that his desire for a second term is to enable him complete projects that he started in 2013.Three years on, the governor has been accused of taking credit for some projects funded by World Bank.Some locals have taken offence over his authoritative leadership, while others claim they have been sidelined in development projects and employment.&ldquo;Saying that I am discriminating is untrue. I have been working hard to ensure that I spread resources and job opportunities evenly because it is my wish that every region is improved,&rdquo; Mandago said.Dr Serem, 44, a first timer in the field of politics, maintains that he has the necessary qualities to transform the lives of constituents through citizen-oriented leadership.&ldquo;I want to stick to priorities highlighted by different groups in the county and not necessarily force programmes on the educated citizens in the name of governing them. What is happening now is not ideal and change is the ultimate solution,&rdquo; he said promising to offer servant leadership if elected.Rugut 37, is the only female candidate who has declared interest in the seat and she believes that empowering women and the youth is the ultimate solution for the challenges facing the society.The mother of three who hails from Cheptiret, Kesses Constituency will prioritise good roads, improved agriculture for farmers along with health which she insisted has not been fully addressed by the current administration.&ldquo;I have been working in Juba in South Sudan and I have gained vast experience, which I believe will assist me in getting to know what is best for the public, all regions have to be heard irrespective of tribe,&rdquo; she said.Misoi, 30, arguably the youngest contender is also a new entrant into politics, and despite his age he believes he is best placed to step in and revolutionise the county by promoting policies that will see locals thrive through devolved funds.&ldquo;As a banker, despite my age, I believe every citizen has a right to provide leadership and I am taking up the challenge to improve regional agriculture so that we can make use of Eldoret Airport for export,&rdquo; he said.
