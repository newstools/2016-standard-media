Commercial Bank of Africa has upset the banking industry after it chose to use the lower of the two controversial benchmark rates to set interest on loans.Unlike its peers who have grudgingly been lowering their rates using the Central Bank Rate (CBR), CBA said it will base its lending rates on the Kenya Banks Reference Rate (KBRR) as advised from time to time by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). &ldquo;KBRR currently stands 8.9 per cent. As a result, CBA will lend at a maximum interest rate of 12.9 per cent,&rdquo; the lender said on Friday.At 12.9 per cent, CBA becomes the cheapest lender in the market at the moment and is set to take on SACCOS that lend averagely at 12 per cent.The bank said it will pay a minimum interest rate of 6.23 per cent (70 per cent of KBRR) on local currency interest-bearing deposits.Waiting for guidelines&ldquo;Our decision to effect the changes based on the KBRR has been informed by our commitment to fully comply with the letter and spirit of the law as well as our long-standing brand promise to enable our customers get more out of life,&rdquo; CBA Group Managing Director Isaac Awuondo said.CBA&rsquo;s move is set to throw banks into a fresh spin and deepen the confusion on the rate that banks are expected to use under the new interest rate-controlled regime.CBK has evaded questions on the rate and kept lenders guessing even as it directed banks to make sure they comply with the new law by Wednesday, September 14.For instance, I&amp;M Bank has maintained that it will delay implementation of the new banking law until the regulator gives directions on the same.The mid-tier lender told its customers last week that is still waiting for guidelines from the regulator on deposit rates. The new law requires banks to pay up to 70 per cent interest on deposits.&ldquo;With reference to our email communication dated 5th September 2016, please note that this is a general notification based on the Act. We are awaiting guidelines from the Central Bank of Kenya and further details will be communicated in due course on how the existing products and facilities with the bank as well as the new ones will be handled,&rdquo; the bank said in an email to its customers.It, however, said it would implement the cap on lending rates from September 14. While some lenders have resorted to the CBR as the rate to use in pricing new loans, some players have said the law is vague and cannot be implemented without guidelines from CBK.In a circular to all chief executives of commercial banks and mortgage finance companies, CBK Governor Dr Patrick Njoroge warned lenders who charge borrowers more than the stipulated interest rates that they will be fined Sh1 million or their bank chief executives imprisoned for one year.&ldquo;A bank or financial institution which contravenes the provisions of subsection (2) commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine of not less than one million shillings, or in default, the CEO of the bank or financial institution shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not less than one year,&rdquo; said Njoroge in the notice.He, however, steered clear of the debate on which rate lenders should use.The law requires lenders to disclose all the charges and terms relating to the loan before entering into agreement with borrower.
