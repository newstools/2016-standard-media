Busolo on Tuesday confirmed that the factories had enough sugar in their stores. &quot;Latest statistics shows we have close to 100, 000 bags of sugar of sugar in our factories stores meaning the shortage claims are farfetched,&quot; explained Busolo.According to him, Kakamega North based West Kenya Sugar company has over 40, 000 bags of sugar in their stores while both Nzoia and Butali sugar factories have each 20, 000 bags which translates to over 4, 000 metric tons.Butali Finance Manager Dan Kiyondi confirmed that the factory had thousands of bags of sugar yet to be released.Busolo directed all supermarkets to acknowledged source of the repackaged sugar as required by the law. &quot;Those who will be found breaching the provision will face the regulator&#39;s wrath.&quot;
