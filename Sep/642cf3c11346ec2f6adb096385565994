A suspected Chicken thief was lynched at Bar-Kowino sub-location in Siaya County.The incident occurred yesterday morning when irate villagers nabbed him stealing chicken at a home in the area and beat him up before killing him. The area OCPD Paul Kiarie confirmed that the deceased who was identified as William Afwamba,35, had gone to the home of John Ogoye where he attempted to steal before he was caught.&quot;Ogoye heard commotion in his poultry house and when he went to check what could be happening, he found the deceased packing them in a crate,&quot; said Kiarie.The police boss added that efforts by Ogoye to restrain Afwamba from escaping were futile as he overpowered him.&quot;The deceased attempted to strangle the chicken owner and even bit him before he raised alarm,&quot; said Kiarie adding that the body had been moved to Bondo sub-county hospital mortuary.Upon realizing that that the suspect is likely to escape, Ogoye decided to raise alarm, alerting his neighbors who caught up with the suspect, beating him to death.This incident comes in the wake of increased cases of armed robberies in the area, with attacks occurring as early as 6pm.Investigations have established that the gangs were made up of known criminals working in cohorts with police.On Wednesday, angry residents who spoke to The Standard accused police of not doing enough to stem insecurity.&quot;Some of the criminals are usually clad in police uniforms and stage well coordinated attacks, without being arrested,&quot; a victim of the attack said.Enraged residents accused police of taking long to respond to alarm each time the gangs strike.According to a victim who sought anonymity for fear of reprisal, he was robbed twice at gunpoint. She said a police officer later demanded Sh20,000 in order to disclose to her the robbers.&quot;I had given up with my business and was just planning to close down following the numerous attacks by gunmen,&quot; she said adding that since the officer was transferred, no cases of armed robbery have been witnessed in West Yimbo location.This comes amid claims by a senior administrator that some Provincial Administrators and police officers were protecting criminals.He said some administrators and police officers let the criminals operate with abandon after collecting &quot;protection fee&quot;, a move he said is the biggest impediment in the war against insecurity.Kiarie has however dismissed claims that his officers were involved in crime.Even though Bondo sub-county Community policing was disbanded,the audacity with which they are operating has raised questions over police complicity in the crimes.Last year, a senior police officer allegedly killed a 20-year-old motorbike rider in Usenge town, in what a source within the police termed as a deal gone sour.&quot;The boy was murdered for fear of disclosing some sensitive information,&quot; said the officer adding that the senior officer has since been transferred.
