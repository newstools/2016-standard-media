Samsung and LG Electronics were accused of agreeing not to poach each other&#39;s U.S. employees, according to a U.S. civil lawsuit filed last week, in what has become a familiar allegation in Silicon Valley.The proposed class action, filed in a Northern California federal court by a former LG sales manager, accuses Samsung and LG of antitrust violations and driving down employee wages. The case is similar to one against Apple Inc , Google and other tech companies which settled last year for $415 million. An LG spokesman said &quot;no such agreement has ever existed&quot; and the accusation was without merit. Samsung declined to comment.The plaintiff, A. Frost, says in the lawsuit that a recruiter contacted Frost via LinkedIn in 2013, seeking to fill a position with Samsung.According to the lawsuit, the recruiter then informed Frost the same day: &quot;I made a mistake! I&#39;m not supposed to poach LG for Samsung!!! Sorry! The two companies have an agreement that they won&#39;t steal each other&#39;s employees.&quot;It is &quot;implausible&quot; that such a deal in the United States could have been reached without the consent of each company&#39;s corporate parent in South Korea, says the lawsuit, which does not state a specific damages amount.Joseph Saveri, an attorney for Frost who had also filed the previous cases against Apple and Google, said the no-poaching agreements are inherently anticompetitive.&quot;There is nothing more fundamental than the ability to get fairly paid for one&#39;s worth and talents,&quot; he said.The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is A. Frost vs. LG Corporation, LG Electronics Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al., 16-5206.
