[Photo: Peter Ochieng]The row over the appointment of Prof Laban Ayiro as acting Vice Chancellor of Moi University may be far from over after Education CS Fred Matiang&#39;i said the decision would not be rescinded. Matiang&#39;i yesterday explained that he followed the law and ruled out any engagement with politicians, a day after two governors and MPs who prefer Prof Isaac Kosgey stormed the university.&quot;The management of universities is governed by Universities Act and I followed the law in the whole process. I cannot engage with political leaders as I am not a politician. This is a process which invokes multiple stakeholders,&quot; the CS said.&quot;The Governing Council sent me a list of three persons who can be appointed to act. I went by what they guided me with and picked the number one proposal. All the three were eminent academicians within Moi University,&quot; Matiang&#39;i told the media, adding that he was satisfied with the leadership at the institution.Supported appointmentRepresentatives of lecturers and students in Moi University also supported the appointment of Prof Ayiro.Officials of the University Academic Staff Union (Uasu) officials and the student leaders asked politicians to keep off affairs of the institution.&quot;Institution leaderships across the country should be de-politicised and de-ethnicised. As Uasu, we fully support Ayiro&#39;s appointment and we are ready to work with him,&quot; declared Moi University Uasu chapter secretary general Jack Willis Abok.&quot;This University is an independent entity separate from politics and communities and politics should therefore be kept away. There is a due process that should be followed in appointing a VC and as students, we will work with whoever is appointed,&quot; said Edwin Amboso, a student leader at the School of law.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago alleged they had been frustrated by the Ministry of Education over the management of the institution.&quot;The University Council did its job with integrity and forwarded names of candidates to the VC position. The recruitment process was done and we know Prof Kosgey emerged top and he should be appointed as the substantive VC immediately,&quot; said Mandago.Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi claimed that MPs from three North Rift Counties had sat down with Prof Kosgey &#39;to discuss the transformation of the University&#39; after they allegedly found out that he had emerged top in the interview.&quot;We talked with him (Kosgey) about the welfare of casual employees and agreed, appointment of the acting VC is a game-plan of some people to push their preferred candidate in place of Kosgey. I will personally not allow the graduation (today&#39;s) to take place by mobilising our supporters to fell trees and block all roads until Kosgey is confirmed to be the VC,&quot; threatened Sudi.Elgeiyo-Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos said he had been urged by his electorate to defend Kosgey&#39;s appointment, adding Matiang&#39;i should ensure the best candidate gets the job.&quot;All MPs from my county were in Nairobi for the meeting and the CS should do the honourable thing by appointing the best candidate permanently and confirm those on acting capacity to enable the university move forward,&quot; said Tolgos.The developments at Moi University mirrored controversies stoked by area politicians that rocked University of Eldoret and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital last year.At the University of Eldoret, violent protests followed the appointment of Prof Teresia Akenga. Uasin Gishu Senator Isaac Melly was roughed up by police when he stormed the University to protest Prof Akenga&#39;s appointment.At the MTRH, confusion reigned before the retirement of then Chief Executive Officer Dr John Kibosia and sparked demonstrations by local residents who wanted him retained.Dr Kibosia at one time circulated a memo to all staff to clarify that there had been no change in the leadership of the hospital.On Tuesday, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos and MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Silas Tiren (Moiben), James Bett (Kesses) and Uasin Gishu County Assembly Speaker Isaac Terer stormed Moi University.The university is among a host of public institutions that have contributed to the steady growth and urbanisation of Eldoret town, the commercial hub of the North Rift.Brenda Chepkosgei, a clothes vendor, says Cheboiyo market just adjacent to the Main campus popularly referred to as Mabatini, has thrived because of the growing population of students.&quot;There is a market day every Saturday at Cheboiywo and this region has tapped a lot financially because of the student population. Plot owners have also benefited from students who rent premises due to shortages after the government introduced double intake and Privately Sponsored Students Program (PSSP),&quot; explained Chepkosgei.
