Live-streaming and instant videos are turning into a fundamental part of life now that many people have constant access to a video camera and an Internet connection right in their pockets.This development can be attributed to popularity of video apps, such as Snapchat and Twitter&rsquo;s Periscope, that have helped make video the current obsession of almost all other social media platforms. Now, Facebook&rsquo;s latest move is intent on giving you more communication options beyond text messaging by giving users the ability to share videos with friends while conversing with them on Messenger.This is a new feature appended to the popular messaging service, which recently hit the 1 billion mark. The app already has a video calling feature, but instant video is all about quick visuals that can supplement the user&rsquo;s existing text messages.To use this feature one simply taps the new video icon located within the message threads, which will then activate the phone&rsquo;s camera, allowing them to begin sharing real-time video as they chat.The video then floats over the conversation in Messenger and the recipient will be able to watch it and send theirs as well.Many social media companies today crave daily activity, and are convinced that video is the only way they can now push users to frequently share video information online.We therefore should be expecting new features from other social media platforms that are set to compete with Facebook&rsquo;s new feature instant video messaging feature.
