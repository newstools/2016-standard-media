ELDORET, KENYA: The government has earmarked Sh200 million towards empowering youth to engage more&nbsp;in agri- business innovation that will enhance sustainable food security in the country.Agriculture Cabinet Secretary (CS) Willy Bett said ambitious plans are in place through Agri- Revolution forum that will create investment for youth to build their economy by actively adopting new technologies that will attract them to agriculture. &#39;&#39;We want to engage the youth to use technology to invest in agriculture in order to boost business in the Country. Its unfortunate the average age for farmers in this country is 60, while the youth have been ignored. We want to incorporate the youth who are still active to employ technology in agriculture in a bid to improve on productivity in the sector,&#39;&#39; Bett said.Speaking at the 5th Edition of the annual University of Eldoret (UOE) Agribusiness trade fair 2016 at the weekend, the CS said they are working on policies to advance commercialisation of agriculture in the region.The CS said the government is also addressing climate change effects that has hit farmers in the region.&#39;&#39;Our concern is most farmers in the country have been hurt by climate change and maize diseases in the past years. Farmers have also experienced losses of produce due to pest manifestation. And researchers are already addressing the challenge through development of resistant varieties among other mitigation steps,&quot; Bett added.The CS said the government is working on a programme to involve the youth in agribusiness investment in accessing credit capital, land lease and fishery economy.He said the focus is on blue economy by exploiting water resources. He said they will promote fish industry in the country saying a ban has been put on illegal fishing by foreign ships who exploit Kenyan water.He said the government will soon open up National Cereal and Produce Board (NCPB) stores to allow farmers deliver their produce on harvesting. Bett said he has already given a directive to ensure NCPB is&nbsp;operational in a month&rsquo;s time once logistic issues have been finalized.&quot;We know this is harvesting season and some unscrupulous middlemen have started opening up some stores in town to buy maize at cheap price. We cannot allow middlemen to exploit farmers in the region,&quot; he said.The CS said State will ensure that subsidized fertilizers is available by December before the next planting season.
