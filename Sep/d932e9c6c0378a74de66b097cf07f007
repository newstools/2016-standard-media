PHOTO: COURTESYThe Orange Democratic Movement has promised to make two main announcements in Nairobi today. ODM deputy leader Ali Hassan Joho promised to lead a peaceful procession of party supporters to Masinde Muliro grounds in Mathare at noon today.Area MP Steven Kariuki announced that he had shelved his plans to hold a Jubilee rally at the same venue. On Friday, the two parties announced that they would use the venue for what they termed as popularisation of their political outfits and presidential candidates.Announcing his decision to back down on his proposed rally, Kariuki blamed Nairobi City Governor Evans Kidero of &ldquo;bulldozing his way to secure the venue for ODM&rdquo;.A possible clash between ODM and Jubilee supporters has been averted after the former backed down on holding a rally at Masinde Muliro grounds in Mathare, in Nairobi today.Both parties had booked the same venue. Mathare MP Steven Kariuki yesterday said he had shelved plans to use the venue to popularise Jubilee Party (JP) and accused Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero of bulldozing to have ODM use the grounds.Earlier, ODM leaders had insisted they would not back down on plans to use the grounds.Addressing the Press at Orange House in Nairobi yesterday, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho asserted that they were not out to cause chaos insisting they would ensure peaceful activities.Mr Kariuki, who defected from ODM to JP, had earlier written to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet seeking security ahead of the rally today.&ldquo;As you are aware, we recently launched the JP which will be our re-election party under the leadership of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto. In this regard, there could be no other better way (than the rally) of popularising the party,&rdquo; read the letter in part.The MP protested that the governor had used his powers to ensure ODM was granted permission to use the Masinde Muliro grounds.&ldquo;Kidero bulldozed his way and using his powers directed that ODM be given the rights to use the grounds. However, will be holding our rally at Mulango Kubwa within the constituency. I hope they (ODM) will not come to disturb people here by being violent,&rdquo; said Kariuki.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the letter, the MP had indicated there will be also a development project inspection tour before the rally.Mr Joho said they were not bothered by the claims Jubilee was making on the grounds, insisting they booked the venue early enough.&ldquo;I am not in a position to speak for Jubilee. What I know is that we booked the venue early enough so that is their own business,&rdquo; he said.The governor said they will be making two &lsquo;major&rsquo; announcements to the Nairobi people: &ldquo;We are moving as ODM to address the serious issues affecting the common people. We have two main messages to pass on regards to leadership but we will also be addressing other issues.&rdquo;Joho who was accompanied by Dr Kidero and Nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro at Orange house gave today&rsquo;s programme. ODM supporters from Nairobi and Mombasa were present.He added: &ldquo;We have invited all (ODM) elected and nominated Members of County Assembly and MPs who will be part of the entourage.&rdquo;The rally at Mathare has been scheduled for 12pm after the leaders transverse different sub-counties and constituencies.&ldquo;We are here (Orange House) to plan our itinerary for tomorrow. All we can say for now is that the rally will pass several constituencies and sub counties before the major rally in Mathare at 12 pm,&rdquo; said Kidero.
