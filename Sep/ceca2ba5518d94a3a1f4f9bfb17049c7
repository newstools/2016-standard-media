Scientific research into how polyester pants affect the sex life of rats, what it&#39;s like for a human to live like a badger and how different the world looks when viewed through your legs was honored at this year&#39;s Ig Nobel spoof awards.The group also took a dig at Volkswagen AG, lauding it in chemistry for engineering its vehicles to produce fewer emissions &quot;whenever the cars are being tested.&quot;The prizes will be awarded for a 26th straight year at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Thursday by a group of actual Nobel Prize winners, and are intended to honor accomplishments in science and humanities that make one laugh, then think. &quot;The prizes are for something pretty unusual,&quot; said Marc Abrahams, editor of the Annals of Improbable Research, and host of the awards. &quot;Almost any other kind of award is for the best or worst. Best or worst is irrelevant to us.&quot;Timeliness is also of limited consideration: The Ig Nobel Reproduction Prize went to the late Ahmed Shafik of Egypt, who died in 2007, for a 1993 paper documenting that rats who wore polyester or polyester-cotton blend pants were less sexually active than those who wore cotton or wool pants or conformed to rat norms and wore no garments of any kind.The paper suggested that &quot;electrostatic fields&quot; created by polyester pants could play a role in impotence.&quot;We have never heard of anybody else who carefully spent time examining what happens sexually to rats if you put pants on them,&quot; Abrahams said.Two Britons split this year&#39;s Biology Ig Nobel. Oxford University fellow Charles Foster, was honored for his book &quot;Being a Beast,&quot; chronicling his experiments in living as a badger, including digging a den to sleep in and eating worms.Countryman Thomas Thwaites&#39; work was in a similar vein; he built a set of prosthetic leg extensions to try living like a goat in Switzerland.Japan&#39;s Atsuki Higashiyama and Kohei Adachi were granted the Perception Ig Nobel for a paper on how objects look different when one bends over and views them through one&#39;s legs.Volkswagen&#39;s award was more ignominious, going to the company for equipping its vehicles with a &quot;defeat device,&quot; which activated the emission controls of an engine undergoing government tests and deactivated them afterward.VW has already agreed to spend up to $16.5 billion to address U.S. environmental, state and owner claims.
