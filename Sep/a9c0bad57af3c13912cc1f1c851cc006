Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) hopes to recover more than Sh200 billion after the implementation of Electronic Goods Management System (EGMS).Launched a few weeks ago, the new mobile app will help consumers to authenticate the legitimacy of excisable goods including all alcoholic drinks and tobacco.The application, downloadable on a smart phone, will help identify fake goods to combat illicit trade and seal revenue leakages, enforcing tax compliance. Speaking at a mobile app sensitisation forum yesterday, KRA Head of Marketing Surveillance Caxton Masudi said that within the period after implementation, the Authority had collected Sh11 billion more.He added, &ldquo;From the time we started applying this system, we have actually reversed the downward trend of excise duty.&rdquo;
