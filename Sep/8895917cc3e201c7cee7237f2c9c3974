Battle for the governorship in Mt Kenya counties has sparked of animosity as incumbents and aspirants seek to out do each other.Violent confrontations among leaders have been witnessed recently, while other parties have moved to court in a bid to block rivals from vying for the position. A case on point is Kiambu Governor William Kabogo who moved to court to challenge Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu&rsquo;s qualifications for governorship. However, Mr Waititu has insisted that he will be in the contest.Last Sunday, Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti nearly engaged in fist fight after Ms Mbarire accused the senator of undermining her in her constituency (See separate story on Page 20). Both leaders are seeking to unseat Embu Governor Martin Wambora.On Friday, Mr Kivuti publicly declared his interest in the position after he was endorsed by Nyangi and Ngome councils of elders at his home in Mbeere North.The Senator said he has been holding consultations with the elders since Monday and they resolved that he declares his intention to end speculations on his candidature.&ldquo;I had to heed to the elders who have been pushing me to vie for the gubernatorial seat. I am grateful for their endorsement, blessings and support,&rdquo; he said.Kivuti referred to a pre-2013 General Election Memorandum of Understanding on guided democracy by Embu leaders and elders that provided that should the governor hail from the Embu community, the Senator should be from the Mbeere sub-tribe.He said since the current governor is from Embu, then the pact should be respected to allow a candidate for Mbeere to take over the seat. The MoU if honoured, will deal a blow to Mr Wambora and Mbarire who are from Embu.Mr Eston Nyaga, the chairman of Ngome Council of elders hailed Kivuti&rsquo;s achievements and promised to drum up support for him in the county.A month ago, there was tension at a women group&rsquo;s funds drive presided by Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau&rsquo;s wife, Mrs Agnes Irungu, after Murang&rsquo;a Governor Mwangi wa Iria and his supporters stormed the venue forcing some members to flee for fear of their safety.Forced outMrs Irungu was also forced to leave the event early, only to find the exit blocked by Mr Iria&rsquo;s motorcade. Last month, Mr Kamau officially launched his bid for Murang&rsquo;a governorship.&ldquo;Kigumo has been topping academically for the last three years and many people ask me what I did to the constituency. My philosophy is that service to mankind is service to God and residents of Murang&rsquo;a want the same glory extended to the entire county,&rdquo; he said.And last week, Laikipia Governor Joshua Irungu lost the bid to remove his name from a case in which sacked County Secretary John Mwaniki is seeking reinstatement.Mr Mwaniki claimed Mr Irungu&rsquo;s decision to sack him was malicious and driven by the fact that he intends to unseat him. The Employment and Labour Relations court in Nakuru dismissed the governor&rsquo;s application and ordered him to pay costs of the suit.Irungu argued that his inclusion in the suit was an abuse of the court process motivated by malice and aimed at embarrassing him.&ldquo;The claim is fatally and incurably defective and bad in law as there was no breach of law and due process does not constitute unfair dismissal as alleged,&rdquo; he said in court papers. However, in his ruling Justice Stephen Radido rejected all the grounds raised by the governor saying that they failed to meet legal threshold and there were facts that were yet to be ascertained.Laikipia Deputy Governor Gitonga Kabugi and hotelier Mburu Kamau, among others are seeking to unseat Irungu. Already, almost 10 MPs and Senators have declared interest in the governor&rsquo;s seat. The hopefuls are Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi and first time MP, Muthomi Njuki of Chuka Igambang&rsquo;ombe constituency who wants to unseat Tharaka Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa.Kiraitu has criticised Meru Governor Peter Munya&rsquo;s leadership style.&ldquo;Munya is my friend, but when it comes to the larger Meru, I feel he has failed the people who elected us. I will also ensure unity of all Meru people regardless of sub-tribes and ensure equal job opportunities, I will make Meru a model County,&rdquo; he said through his Director of Communications Mr Patrick Muriungi.&mdash;Additional reporting by Joseph Muchiri
