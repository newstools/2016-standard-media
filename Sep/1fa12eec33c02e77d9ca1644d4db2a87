At around 9pm on December 27, 2006 Peter Kinuthia was at his shop, in Bahati, Nakuru County, and was preparing to close down his business after a long day.As the customers dwindled, Kinuthia began to count the money he had made that day and it was then his eldest son William Mugo, accompanied by Simon Maina who owned a shop nearby, walked into the shop. Kinuthia continued to count his day&rsquo;s earning as the two younger men continued chatting. Then in an unexpected turn of events, one the men hit him on the head with a sharp object, quickly gagged him so he could not scream and tied him up. They then took Sh63,000 and quickly walked out of the shop.Kinuthia struggled and freed himself then ran towards his home to alert his family. On the way, he met two of his sons Daniel Gichuki and David Wanjau and his wife who accompanied him back to the shop to lock up.The family reported the incident to police and Kinuthia was taken to hospital for treatment.Maina and Mugo were arrested and were positively identified through a police identification parade by Kinuthia, and were charged with robbery with violence.Daniel would later testify that on the night of the attack, he was going to his father&rsquo;s shop and was surprised to find his brother Mugo standing outside the shop wielding a panga.He said when he peeped into the business premises, he saw Maina searching for money and that he then ran home to arm himself and inform his family members of what was going on. In his defense, Mugo claimed he was in Thika where he worked and only heard of the attack on his father through elders in the village.Mugo said he was surprised that his father and brother had accused him of being one of the robbers and attributed the allegation to the fact that there had been disagreements between them because Kinuthia had married a second wife.Maina claimed that on the night Kinuthia was attacked he spent the day at his shop, and was arrested the next day when he was shopping for goods for his shop.On December 9 the trial judge found them both guilty and sentenced them to death.They, however, appealed the court&rsquo;s decision but on August 2, 2016, Nyeri Court of Appeal judges Roselyn Naliaka, Philomena Mbete and Patrick Kiage dismissed their appeal.The Appellate Court Judges noted that there was no doubt about the identification of Mugo and Maina because both of them were known to Kinuthia and Daniel.
