Kenya contributed Sh500 million to the fund this year.&quot;The commitments made today by long-standing and new donors will save millions of lives and give the most vulnerable &ndash; especially women and girls &ndash; an opportunity to live up to their full potential,&quot; said Gates.The fund which was initiated in 2002 has increasingly and continuously made healthcare affordable and accessible to more people especially in low and middle income countries.Gates noted, &quot;Fund has consistently proven that it is one of the most impactful investments a donor can make in global health. By continually innovating to make health products more affordable and accessible, and identifying new approaches for prevention and treatment, the Global Fund has delivered incredible results.&quot;He also pointed out that it is why the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is proud to join other global leaders in increasing our support for the Global Fund by pledging up to $600 million for the 2017-2019 budget cycle.
