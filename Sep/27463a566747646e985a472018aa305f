Milk processors have moved to ensure that farmers have enough feeds and maintain optimum production during the low rain season.This follows a warning by the weatherman of depressed rainfall in the last quarter of the year that could lead to reduced milk production. Industry leader Brookside Dairy has launched an aggressive animal feed conservation campaign that targets 145,000 farmers in 27 counties across the country.State-owned New KCC has rolled out a programme to supply hay to farmers to mitigate against reduced grass cover during the dry spell.&ldquo;We have intensified training of farmers on forage preservation. Adequate feed availability, in both quantity and quality, will ensure optimum production throughout the year,&rdquo; John Gethi, Brookside&rsquo;s director of milk procurement, said yesterday during a dairy training course for farmers in Lelan, West Pokot County.The Kenya Meteorological Department&rsquo;s seasonal forecast for October &ndash; November &ndash; December says much of the country is likely to experience depressed rainfall that will be driven mainly by the evolving La Nina conditions in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific Ocean, which is adjacent to the East African coastline.However, processors are leaving nothing to chance as they strategise on how to maintain optimum milk production levels during the said period.The Ruiru-based Brookside has a daily raw milk intake of two million litres at peak, and depressed rains without alternative sources of animal feed would see a reduction of milk supply from farmers.&ldquo;We are currently engaging individual farmers and groups such as dairy co-operatives on the need to establish pasture grasses and fodder crops,&rdquo; Mr Gethi said.Weather reports from high milk production areas such as Nyandarua and parts of Nyeri county point to sporadic occurrence of frost, which has affected pasture cover in the areas. Frost leads to wilting of plants such as forage.Gethi warns that reduced milk production during the dry season would see farmers&rsquo; operational costs shoot up.He said Brookside was using dairy training courses to demonstrate to farmers how to reduce operational costs on the farm for maximum returns.&ldquo;Brookside is working with over 300 dairy co-operative societies across the country to have farmers to supply raw milk as groups to mitigate effect of increased transport costs (with reduced production), and hence benefit from higher prices,&rdquo; Gethi said.He asked dairy farmers to invest in breeds that not only produce more milk but that are also &lsquo;feed efficient&rsquo; to beat the dry weather.&ldquo;Farmers should also consider vaccination of their animals as an early-action recommendation before the La Nina peaks between October and January as advised by the weatherman,&rdquo; Gethi said.
