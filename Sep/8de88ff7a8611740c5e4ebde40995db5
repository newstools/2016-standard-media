Imagine being able to take a picture in the thick of the night and sharing it directly to the preferred destination by use of inbuilt Wi-Fi.Leading camera company, Canon, which was founded in 1937 has hit the market with a camera that has a night vision, once again setting high the bar of photography. The XC15 has excellent low-light capabilities thanks to its wide ISO that ranges from 100 to 20,000, perfect for shooting in difficult lighting conditions such as news interviews in poorly lit areas.Speed or light sensitivity of a digital camera&rsquo;s censor is rated in ISO numbers. Therefore, the higher the number, the faster the response to light.Speaking during this year&rsquo;s Photokina exhibition in Cologne, Germany, Canon marketing director for Central and North Africa, Hendrik Verbrugghe, said the company is excited to be showcasing smart imaging products and hope to inspire photographers in their pursuit of the shot.&ldquo;Canon is reinventing what is possible in the world of imaging, for consumers and professionals alike,&rdquo; he said.The XC15, a compact, 4K (UHD) and full HD (high definition) video camcorder with stills capability is aimed at content creators such as news gatherers and independent or documentary filmmakers.In a follow up to the popular XC10, the XC15 combines the best elements from its predecessor with new features and functionality. It comes with a microphone adapter with dual XLR (electrical connector) inputs for professional audio capture, quick autofocus. This, Verbrugghe said, will ensure that users are assured of both quality sound and image.Also included is a 24p frame rate (24 frames per second) option for cinematographers. &ldquo;Canon&rsquo;s aim is to inspire and enable photographers to capture, store, print and share their lives through the universal language of imagery,&rdquo; Verbrugghe said.During this year&rsquo;s trade fair, Canon, through its ambassador Thorsten Milse and sports photographer, Samo Vidic, equipped participants with different photography styles and techniques.Canon holds the Photokina event once in two years with the aim of commanding the trends of photography. It attracts more than one thousand firms.
