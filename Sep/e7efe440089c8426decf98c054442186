Nakuru, Kenya: Samuel Kamau 31 whose testicles were chopped off by an unknown lady in Nakuru has come out to the public saying he is back to the game again. Kamau who previously worked as a tout at one of the bus terminals in Nakuru&nbsp; before the traumatic encounter said he had stayed for over 5 years without touching a woman&nbsp; after his wife died .&quot;My wife died five years ago after falling sick and since then I have never been involved with any woman, I have never touched or had any sexual relations,&quot; said KamauHe said on that very night when the&nbsp; unfortunate incident took place ,the urge to be with a woman had come in full force and he felt as if he could die if his sexual needs were not attended to urgently.&quot;I had stayed for over five years without touching a woman and when the need came I could not control it so I took in the first woman&nbsp; I met,&quot; said KamauHe said that he had previously tried to control the &quot;evil feeling &quot;according to him through watching Christian programs but the feeling was evil sent and could not go away.He as well said he tried to take long walks but the urge grew stronger to the extent of depriving him the strength to walk saying his manhood became heavy and enlarged.&quot;I tried all means to keep the evil feeling away because I had promised to keep clean until God grants me another wife,&quot; he saidKamau continues to narrate that after fighting the feeling in vain he went to a nearby joint and ordered several rounds of beer which got him drunk silly and there the &quot;woman sent from hell&quot; or rather &ldquo;Mungu leta&rdquo; came.&quot;A woman just came and told me she understands my crazy needs and would offer the services for as low as Sh300 which I quickly accepted because I was at the verge of dying,&quot; he criedHe narrates that he cannot even remember how the lady looks like all he can recall is that she had a dark chocolate complexion, was very attractive and identified herself as Pamela.He narrates that their encounter was heaven sent and he was taken to another world by the anonymous lady &quot;Mungu Leta.&quot;Unfortunately the encounter turned sour when the lady demanded for extra money to continue giving service to Kamau.I could not afford any money and I wanted to continue enjoying the services from the lady so I held her hand and she grabbed a knife and chopped off my balls.Kamau now explains that he has forgiven the woman despite the massive damage he caused him.He as well explains that he was forced to quit his job as a tout after his colleagues started teasing him because of his weakness.&quot;I am still a man and I still attract women and I will settle soon again,&quot; he saidHe added that despite doctors telling him that he will never be able to sire children, women still flock at his house demanding that he marries them&quot;Doctors said that I can still come because when you look at the physiology you see that the fluids are made by the seminal vesicles and the prostate, very little of the fluid and the content is produced in the testes,&quot;said MwangiI still unload!!!!!!He insists that he can still perform and now with more vigour but he has taken a break until God sends him a wife.He however cautioned people to avoid making fun of him because he might be forced to react on impulse and do something that he will regret.&quot;It has not been an easy journey and when somebody makes fun of me I feel like killing them,&quot; he saidKamau now works as a barber and has joined an organisation where men with manly disability air their issues and was quoted saying that most of the men in that group are among the most prominent men in the country.&quot;Most of the men in the organisation are very wealthy, have beautiful wife&#39;s and still hold their families together, that is my goal,&quot; he noted
