Kenyans may soon access advanced medical treatment from top Turkish medical institutions at affordable rates as Turkey and Kenya deepen cooperation in the health sector.Turkish Ambassador to Kenya Deniz Eke has indicated that the Turkish Embassy in Nairobi is working to attract renowned Turkish medical facilities as well as specialised medical personnel to make advanced medical treatments available to Kenyans. &ldquo;We seek to establish partnerships between medical institutions in Turkey and those in Kenya, whether public or private. This will make advanced treatments available to Kenyans locally and in Turkey,&rdquo; she said.The envoy indicated that the proposed partnerships are also expected to enhance transfer of specialised skills and technologies to health facilities and personnel in Kenya.&nbsp; Turkey is a major medical tourism destination.Currently, an annual Turkish government scholarship programme has seen a sizeable number of Kenyans trained in Turkish universities to become Medical Doctors.&ldquo;There is need to explore new models of providing healthcare to citizens especially through partnerships between the public and private sectors. Kenya and Turkey need to share experiences in this vital area,&rdquo; she said.She was speaking on Monday after donating medical equipment at the Kiambu Sub-County Level 4 hospital to help save lives of babies born prematurely.The donations include 40 baby cots, 6 incubators and 4 LED phototherapy machines, 5 paediatric vital signs monitors, bassinets, 5 infrared thermometers and 2 oxygen concentrators. The donations were made through the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA).The envoy said investment in health of children and women has significant impacts on the socio-economic development of any country, including Kenya.The envoy said that in the recent past, Turkey has donated medical equipment and ambulances to health facilities across the country as well as sponsored medical practitioners from varied fields for conferences and trainings in Turkey to enhance their skills and knowledge.&ldquo;Turkey identifies health cooperation as one of its priority areas in its relations and development partnership with Kenya,&rdquo; she said.On his part, Kiambu County Executive for Health Dr. Jonah Mwangi said the donations will go a long way in reducing the number of deaths of newborns including those born prematurely.&nbsp; He said the County plans to expand the new born unit in the hospital in the near future.&ldquo;We will also partner with Turkey especially in the training of health personnel in the county as well transfer of technology from the Turkish medical industry,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
