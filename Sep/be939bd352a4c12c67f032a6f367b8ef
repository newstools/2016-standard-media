Sugar factories have downplayed shortage of the commodity and cited they had enough stocks in their storerooms.Dan Kiyondi, the Finance Manager at Butali Sugar Factories wondered why there is no sugar in the market when their warehouse has a considerable stock. He downplayed claims that there was shortage of sugar in the country. &ldquo;There is no shortage of sugar because in our stores we have about 20,000 bags that have not been released to the market and we are still producing more,&rdquo; said Kiyondi.The Head of Communications at Mumias Sugar Company Moses Owino said there was nothing to worry about. He, however, acknowledged that lack of enough raw materials could have contributed to the shortage. &ldquo;There is no enough sugarcane for the market. We do not have stock now since what we produce daily is taken,&rdquo; he said.A spot check by The Standard yesterday revealed that most of major chain stores in Kakamega had no sugar on their shelves. Some of the obvious brands that are produced by millers in the region and are always on shelves were missing.It was the same case in Mumias, Busia and Bungoma towns. For instance at Tuskys in Kakamega, they had no stocks. Sales Coordinator Jesse Gitonga said lack of sugar had impacted on sales. &ldquo;A customer will pick the trolley, pack it to the brim but immediately they realise there is no sugar, they leave whatout they shopping... because they expect to get everything they want under one roof,&rdquo; he explained.At Nakumatt Midtown in Kakamega the price of sugar has been hiked from Sh250 per two kilogrammee packet to Sh290 but they have not put conditions on the number of packets one should buy.&nbsp;
