Youth and Gender Affairs Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki has said improving access to&nbsp;water&nbsp;and sanitation is&nbsp;key&nbsp;to addressing high&nbsp;maternal&nbsp;deaths. She said providing expectant mothers with basic&nbsp;health&nbsp;services and accurate hygiene information will help reduce such needless deaths.&quot;Emerging evidence suggests that giving birth in a setting without&nbsp;safe&nbsp;drinking&nbsp;water&nbsp;or sanitation has a negative impact on the&nbsp;health&nbsp;and survival of both mother and baby,&quot; Ms Kariuki said. She said lack of&nbsp;safe&nbsp;water&nbsp;and sanitation causes up to 50 per cent under-nutrition worldwide. Kariuki said with improved access to&nbsp;water, women would save on the time they spent looking for the commodity and instead concentrate on other income generating activities.&quot;Easier access to&nbsp;water&nbsp;can enable a woman to&nbsp;water&nbsp;a kitchen garden or do irrigation farming and thereby improve the family&#39;s food security as well as provide an opportunity to earn money by selling the surplus,&quot; she said.Speaking during the closing ceremony of the first women in&nbsp;water&nbsp;and sanitation conference in Naivasha, the CS called for involvement of women in&nbsp;key&nbsp;decision making processes on matters&nbsp;water&nbsp;and sanitation saying it is critical for their empowerment. Senior Assistant Director in the Ministry of&nbsp;Water&nbsp;Morris Opondo said the Government is keen on gender mainstreaming in all departments in the Ministry.
