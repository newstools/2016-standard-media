KISII, KENYA: The government is set to revive pyrethrum farming in the Country, newly appointed Pyrethrum Board of&nbsp;Kenya CEO Andrew Osodo has said.&quot;We want to revive and turn around the Pyrerthrum farming that had reduced significantly over the last six years despite its immense contribution to the national Gross Domestic Product,&quot;&nbsp;he said The Pyrethrum farming was first introduced in the Country in 1928 with an installed processing capacity of 30,000 tons annually thus&nbsp;contributing about Sh10 billion by then.But now, the growing of the crop in large scale had significantly reduced defying the primary purpose for which the pyrethrum processing plant was built.According to Osodo, they are currently only able to process about 500 tons of the crop annually, which is below the installed capacity target.This means unless farmers step up production, the sector would wind up operations.Osodo said this is why the board had resolved to go out to parts of the Country such as Kisii which used to grow the plant in large scale to bolster the crop production and remain virbrant in market&quot;I have already begun to meet the farmers and stakeholders in the sub-sector to find feasible ways&nbsp; in which we can motivate them to increase investments in the sub sector,&quot; said the CEO
