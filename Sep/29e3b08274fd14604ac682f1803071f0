CORD co-principal Kalonzo&nbsp;Musyoka is ready to support anyone&nbsp;picked as the Opposition&rsquo;s flag&nbsp;bearer in order to remove Jubilee&nbsp;from power. Kalonzo revealed that&nbsp;CORD was working on a consensus&nbsp;to avoid a fallout and was even&nbsp;considering registering it as a political&nbsp;party.He revealed they were&nbsp;working on a model similar to National&nbsp;Rainbow Coalition (Narc)&nbsp;that propelled former President&nbsp;Mwai Kibaki to power in 2002 to&nbsp;beat President Uhuru Kenyatta in&nbsp;the 2017 polls.CORD is working on modalities of picking its presidential candidate for next year&#39;s elections. Co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka, who also announced he will soon roll out his campaigns, said they have agreed to support whoever wins the ticket.The Wiper party leader said they are considering registering CORD as a political party and fielding single aspirants for the various seats.He said they have established a technical committee that is currently working on a framework that will be used to select CORD&#39;s presidential candidate, other than consensus.The coalition has reportedly been considering consensus to avoid a fallout that comes with poor methods of identifying a flag bearer.Kalonzo confirmed that there is a technical committee currently working on the framework of the methods to be used apart from consensus in picking the Presidential candidate.Kalonzo, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula and Raila Odinga of ODM are all hoping to clinch the Opposition coalition&#39;s ticket.The former vice president said he will support any of his colleagues if he is not selected to take on President Uhuru Kenyatta of Jubilee Party and help CORD win.&quot;We are considering having the NARC arrangement. But there&#39;s a technical committee that is still on a method of picking the CORD presidential candidate,&quot; Kalonzo said yesterday.&quot;We will let you know once the committee has completed its work,&quot; he added.Kalonzo argued the Opposition to consider the method that propelled former President Mwai Kibaki to power in 2002 on NARC ticket if they are to beat President Kenyatta in the 2017 elections.He said talks are ongoing and that they have opened doors to any proposals on how they can beat Jubilee.&quot;We are still talking among ourselves, we want to get the best way to remove Jubilee from power. We are considering bringing back a coalition such as NARC by reaching out to other parties so we can have a common course,&quot; said Kalonzo.Kalonzo said his party will meet today to plan a series of activities to boost his candidature. This comes on the backdrop of heightened activities by ODM, which has endorsed its leader Raila, as the Opposition&#39;s preferred presidential candidate.However Kalonzo clarified the competing presidential campaigns involving him Raila and Wetang&#39;ula should not be construed to mean CORD is divided.Kalonzo explained CORD co-principals have agreed that each party leader would strengthen their outfit and solidify their strongholds as part of strategy to wrestle power from Jubilee.&quot;We have agreed that we will strengthen our parties. A stronger ODM, Wiper and Ford Kenya is good for us and good for the coalition,&quot; said Kalonzo.Each party will then hold its National Delegates Convention (NDC) to endorse its presidential candidate before picking the coalition&#39;s flag bearer.The Wiper leader has convened the National Executive Council (NEC) today to plan the series of campaigns.Raila who returned to the country from a four-day tour to Germany has on the other hand planned a four day Taita-Taveta and Kwale counties starting today.In a series of political rallies to consolidate his support base and re-energize the party, Raila is set to hold a series of meetings with ODM and community grassroots leaders in Oloitokitok, Taveta, Wundanyi, Mwatate and Voi between tomorrow and Thursday.Wetang&#39;ula has also retreated to his backyard in Western region where the party has endorsed Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale for Kakamega governor.Last week, Wetang&#39;ula indicated that they will institute disciplinary action against its three legislators for donning Jubilee colours.Kalonzo has indicated that he will start his campaigns by pitching tent in Meru, Tharaka Nithi and then head to President Kenyatta&#39;s backyard of Kiambu with a focus of Gatundu North and South.
