A senior police officer was buried after one year as his widows tussled over his multi-million shilling property in Taita sub-County.And the dispute is far from settled. Former Embu West OCPD Nathan Nyange was buried on July 2, this year, at his rural home in Mwabwalo village on the outskirts of Wundanyi town.He died on May 8, 2015, but the corpse lay at the Pandya Hospital mortuary in Mombasa following a High Court injunction stopping the burial in May, last year, when his widows launched rival claims to it.Following a court order in Nairobi in May this year, it was transferred to Wesu Sub-County Hospital in Taita-Taveta County on June 26.ROW NOT OVERBut The Standard has now established that the saga which surrounded the former police boss burial is far from over.Family sources disclosed that one of Nyange&rsquo;s widows has already gone to court to have his body exhumed, claiming that she was not involved in the burial arrangements.&ldquo;The younger widow of the deceased has already gone to court to have the body exhumed. She claims that she was not involved (in the burial) as the High Court had earlier directed,&rdquo; said one of Nyange&rsquo;s close relative who declined to be named.The court had ordered on February 16 this year by consent that the remains of the deceased should be released to the following three persons for burial: Dawtone Nyange Mwangemi (deceased brother), Lily Chemtai Chemweno (applicant) and Agnes Mwero Nyamvula (respondent). Lily and Agnes are the widows.&nbsp; The court also ordered that the burial shall be at Mwabwalo village in Wundanyi division.On July 2 the body was interred in a freshly dug grave after the family resolved the legal tussle. Elders rejected a grave that had been dug when he died last year but was abandoned when the legal dispute erupted.BODY RELEASEDWhen the dispute erupted, the first grave was filled with a live banana stem in accordance with local customs to ward off bad omen. A sheep was not, however, slaughtered to cleanse the grave side in line with Taita traditions and customs as earlier suggested by local elders.In May this year, the High Court in Nairobi ordered release of the body from Pandya Hospital mortuary in Mombasa for burial, but Nyange&rsquo;s family was not able to pay more than Sh 1.2 million accumulated medical and mortuary fees.During the burial on July 2 this year only the deceased&rsquo;s first wife Ms Chemweno and her children attended the burial. The other wife, Ms Nyamvula, a police officer in Mombasa, stayed away.Ms Nyamvula had earlier opposed the collection of the body at the mortuary, saying there was a pending application filed on April 18 in Nairobi between her and her Chemweno seeking to set aside the consent order of the court purportedly issued on February 4.
