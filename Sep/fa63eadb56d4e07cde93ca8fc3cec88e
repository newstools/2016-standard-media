Europe may allow Kenya and Rwanda to export their products duty free if other East African nations fail to sign the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) deal by January.The European Union&rsquo;s ambassador to Kenya, Stefano Dejak has said the Union may consider a separate deal for the two countries.The deadline for signing by East African Community (EAC) countries was initially set for October 1, but was pushed to January to allow consensus among the five EAC members. But under a deal signed in 2001 and renewed in 2011, all EAC countries have to sign to enjoy the benefits. Kenya and Rwanda have already signed the new trade pact that grants them some privileges to the European Union market duty free. Uganda and Tanzania had requested for more time for wider consultation before agreeing to the deal.
