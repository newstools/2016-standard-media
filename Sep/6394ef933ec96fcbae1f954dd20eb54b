Four relatives, among them a former navy soldier, have been arrested for allegedly attempting to bribe military officers in the ongoing recruitment.The suspects were arrested Wednesday morning at Ruring&rsquo;u Stadium in Nyeri County, where the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) recruitment was taking place. Lieutenant Colonel Mathew Lenamunai said the suspects were arrested with Sh86,000, a driving licence and stamps belonging to various KDF institutions.&ldquo;We received intelligence reports that there was a suspect trying to influence the exercise. We followed up the matter and arrested the suspect. He was in possession of Sh86,000 in cash, a mobile phone and the stamps,&rdquo; said Mr Lenamunai.Military officers also arrested an elderly man, his daughter and grandson who were trying to canvass for entry into KDF.&ldquo;We found out that they were colluding to ensure that they influenced the young man&rsquo;s recruitment,&rdquo; he said.Lt Col Lenamunai said the main suspect, who is a son of the elderly man, was a former KDF private. He enrolled in the military in 2007 and resigned in 2009. It was not immediately clear why he resigned and what he does for a living.Following the arrest, KDF officers handed the suspects over to Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officers and the police.However, the recruitment went on as scheduled, with over 200 youths from Nyeri Central sub-county turning up to try their luck.Stained teethMeanwhile, hundreds of youths who turned up in Embu left disappointed after they were disqualified for having stained teeth.KDF recruiting officer Lt Col Patrick Mwashube said they required youths with proper dental structures and anyone with issues was disqualified. He said KDF would conduct a medical study to establish why youths in the region had dental problems. He said they suspected it had to do with the consumption of chlorinated water or miraa.In Samburu, hundreds of women who turned up at Kenyatta Stadium in Maralal town said the recruitment officers barred them from participating in the exercise without giving reasons.The women said KDF had not reserved any slots for them and that all those who were taken were men.&ldquo;I was here at 5am looking for a KDF job but women were not selected. They didn&rsquo;t give us any explanations,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Muthoni, adding that this was unlike other years when slots were usually reserved for women in police recruitment.They said the military had infringed on their right to employment.Jackline Leakono, 21, said Samburu was a hardship area and as such she was capable of performing tough military duties easily.But senior recruiting officer Lt Col Peter Wanga said the gender imbalance was an issue being handled by the human resource department at the military headquarters.&ldquo;We are not taking female candidates at this centre. I know it is a very big issue but that is being handled at the headquarters,&rdquo; he said.&mdash; Reports by Job Weru, Joseph Muchiri and Michael Saitoti
