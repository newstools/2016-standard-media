It was a short, solemn, humble send-off for a fallen Mau Mau veteran who risked his life countless times to offer both financial and material support to Mau Mau soldiers fighting to liberate Kenya from colonial rule.But despite the sacrifice he made for his country, Mwangi Njuguna - alias Daudi Keru, 92, was laid to rest at his farm in Irigithathi village in Kieni, Nyeri County, surrounded by less than 50 desolate family members and friends on August 17. Sitting next to his simple white casket, which was donated by the County Government of Nyeri, was his 71-year-old and only son, John Njuguna, who was confined to a wheelchair due to colon cancer.Unable to speak and overcome with grief, the frail Njuguna let tears roll freely down his cheeks. He watched silently as mourners lowered his father&rsquo;s body into the grave and as they threw soil into the pit, Njuguna collapsed.An ambulance donated by Nyeri County Government rushed him to Consolata Mission Hospital in Mathari where medics worked tirelessly to save his life but he would later die that same evening.His daughter, Hellen Waceke, would later tell us that prior to her grandfather&rsquo;s burial, Njuguna had been detained in a private clinic in Nairobi for months due to a hefty bill.&ldquo;He was diagnosed with colon cancer in May this year and we went to Kenyatta National Hospital Cancer wing. They informed us that the waiting list was very long and we would only get admitted into the programme in January 2018,&rdquo; she said.The family had no choice but to seek medical attention in a private facility where the bill accumulated to Sh400,000.When their grandfather passed away, Njuguna, his only surviving son, demanded that he must be present at his father&rsquo;s burial. The family had to borrow money to pay half the bill so their father could attend the funeral.The dust has not even settled on their grandfather&rsquo;s grave and now the family finds themselves in debt, deliberating on whether or not to sell the family property to pay the hospital bills.Because Keru was a renown freedom fighter, the family had hoped he would receive compensation but this is yet to materialise.&ldquo;My grandfather was a member of the Mau Mau Veterans Association and there were always promises that eventually they would receive a pay out, but now he has died without ever seeing it,&rdquo; Waceke said.The funeral took place outside his wooden one room house. Attended by mourners, many of whom were too young to fully grasp the sacrifice Keru made to liberate the country.There was not pomp and colour, no government officials in sight or dignitaries just his family who now must go on without the two men who were pillars of their home. The family, however, hailed Nyeri County government for the donation of a casket and an ambulance to take Njuguna to hospital after he was taken ill, and also Kieni MP Kanini Kega who donated cash, despite being outside the country at the time.Keru was known for his long shoulder length dreadlocks. He stubbornly refused to cut his hair and joined the Mau Mau liberation movement as a young man.In 1952, when he was living in Embu, he was imprisoned for donning the characteristic Mau Mau dreadlocks and sent to Manyani prison for one year. He was later sent to Baringo were he was incarcerated for eight months and later transferred to Gathingiriri for an additional five months and was released on February 20 1963.His vow to never cut his hair despite intimidation tactics of the white settlers was his way of showing solidarity for the struggle.After independence, Keru refused to cut his long hair, hoping that when time for Mau Mau to receive their just reward came, he would have proof of his active role in the liberation struggle.However, after years of waiting and his health gradually fading he realised his dreams and hopes of a better life for his children from the government were perhaps the musings of an old man.
