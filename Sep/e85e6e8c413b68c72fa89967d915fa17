The unveiling of Jubilee Party (JP) last week has left no doubt that Bomet County will yet again be a key battle ground in the 2017 elections.The county is home to rebel politicians in Rift Valley, a tag it has held since the days of former Cabinet Minister Kipkalya Kones. Governor Isaac Ruto&rsquo;s opposition to the Jubilee merger is the latest rebellion. Ruto is one, and the most vocal, of the many politicians from the county and the larger Kipsigis community -- which inhabits Bomet and has a sizeable presence in Nakuru -- who have chosen to rebel against Jubilee and senior community politicians.But unlike earlier leaders who chose to decamp to opposition parties after falling out with the ruling regime, Ruto has a different path and formed his own political vehicle.The governor was a close ally of the late Kones, and like the late politician, speaks his mind on issues affecting the Kipsigis community. He has grown immensely popular by taking on the Jubilee administration for neglecting the region.When Kones fell out with former President Moi, he mounted a rebellion against his regime in Bomet, drawing the political attention of the country. The region was then a Kanu zone and persistently voted out anyone trying to oppose it.As political fate would have it, Kones lost terribly in the 2002 elections to current Kanu Secretary General Nick Salat in the contest for the Bomet parliamentary seat.Kones, who had held on to the seat for nearly 15 years, had tried to lead a mass exit from the then ruling party to Ford People. A similar scenario is playing out against the fiery Bomet governor, who has fallen out with Deputy President William Ruto.Political observers have however termed his decision to form a new party to run against Jubilee as &lsquo;tragic&rsquo;.Public spats with the Deputy President have been viewed as disrespectful and has become a political talking point.&ldquo;It will be a race between those loyal to Jubilee and Governor Ruto who has defied the Deputy President,&rdquo; Ivor Korir a political analyst said.In a recent visit to Bomet, the DP vowed to ensure that he be voted out.&ldquo;I will work tirelessly to ensure that a Jubilee governor is elected in Bomet so that the divisions we are seeing are dealt with once and for all,&rdquo; the DP declared at Silibwet sports ground during his last visit to Bomet.But Ruto has vowed to stay put, saying the DP has no power to decide who becomes governor.&ldquo;I was shocked to hear the DP declare that I should be voted out as if he makes that decision. The people of Bomet will decide and I am optimistic that they will have me back in office due to the good service I have rendered,&rdquo; said the governor.As he continues to mount his rebellion, three aspirants have expressed interest in his seat through the ruling party&rsquo;s ticket. The three -- Sotik MP and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso, former Konoin MP Julius Kones and Bomet Deputy Governor Stephen Mutai.Laboso, being the senior most politician among the aspirants owing to her position as deputy speaker, has been endorsed by MPs from Bomet County to take on the governor.Kones has mounted a serious campaign to redeem his image after losing out to Ruto in the 2013 polls.But many view the National Water and Pipeline Cooperation Chairman with a lot of suspicion after he decamped to Kenya National Congress (KNC) after losing the URP nomination in 2013 to Ruto.&ldquo;I learnt my lessons during the last election when I contested against Governor Ruto and lost narrowly despite running on a party that was no so popular in the region,&rdquo; he said.Mutai is pushing his luck on the experience he has gained as the deputy Governor saying he was the favorite candidate.&ldquo;I have seen how the system works and I know the mess done by Governor Ruto,&rdquo; he says.
