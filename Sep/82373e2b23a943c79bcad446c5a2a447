The majority of people on Earth can be defined by one of four different personality types, a new study has found.These are either optimistic, pessimistic, trusting or envious. And, according to the science, most of us fall into that last category.Scientists at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid put 541 different people into hundreds of different social situations that required them to either collaborate or conflict with others.The team recorded their responses and fed the data into a computer to analyse.The result, which was published in the journal Science Advances , showed the largest group (30% of participants) were defined as envious. Meaning they don&#39;t mind what they achieve, as long as they&#39;re better than everyone else.&quot;This type of classification algorithm has previously been used with success in other fields, such as biology,&quot; explained Jordi Duch, one of the authors of the study.Last on this list is the trusting group, who are classed as natural collaborators who don&#39;t mind if they win or lose.The different personalities were defined through a hunting metaphor: Two people can hunt for deer together, but alone they&#39;re only able to catch rabbits.EnviousThis person would choose to hunt rabbits - so they are at least equal to the other hunter, if not better.OptimistAn optimist would choose to hunt deer - because it&#39;s the best option for both people.PessimistPessimists choose to hunt rabbits because then they are much more likely to catch the smaller target.TrustingThese people are happy to co-operate and hunt deer without a second thought.So go on, which do you think you are?
