A new housing development by the Kenya Medical Association is changing the face of Mtwapa in Kilifi Country. The Sh1 billion complex consists of 20 blocks, each with eight two-bedroom apartments on a five-acre plot located just after Greenwood Resort.It was completed in June and is ready for occupation. Each of the 160 apartments has an ensuite bedroom with an extra bathroom for guests. A reverse osmosis water purifier ensures that residents of this estate always have clean water, with options for hot water instant showers. Other features include a cabro-paved driving track, swimming pool, gym, restaurant, supermarket, conference facilities, a bio-digester and landscaped areas.According to Benedict Mutuku of Goldwyne Consult, the marketing agents, although Mtwapa does not suffer endemic insecurity, the developers have ensured adequate safety measures are in place.Mtwapa is also attracting other projects. Located about 16 kilometres North East of Mombasa, the area attracts foreigners, who have contributed to its property market growth.Latest trendResidential homes, low-cost rental villas,&nbsp;religious and recreational centres dot Mtwapa&rsquo;s landscape.Analysts say the area will continue to grow due to the congestion of Mombasa. Experts attribute Mtwapa&rsquo;s growth to availability of land and its strategic location.Land is cheaper in Mtwapa than in Mombasa, making it attractive to developers and manufacturers. But the real property revolution in the area is the emergence of apartment complexes put up mainly by companies.Mutuku said Mtwapa is one of the most vibrant towns in the region.&ldquo;Mtwapa is a 24-hour economy, with all the amenities befitting a city. There are financial institutions, churches, shopping complexes, schools as well as entertainment joints all over,&rdquo; he said.Other mega projects in the area include Vipingo Ridge, a prestigious 18-hole golf development sitting on a 2,500 acres; Sultan Palace; Mtwapa Garden Villas; and Vescon Estate.For along time, Mtwapa and other areasin the region have always played second fiddle to Mombasa, but if the current trend is anything to go by, it is safe to say that these areas are establishing their own identity.
