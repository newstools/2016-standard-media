The first few weeks in university is a period of disorientation for new students, popularly known as freshmen, who are yet to adjust to their new surroundings.However, freshmen going to Dedan Kimathi University of Technology will have no such challenges since a group of students have come up with a mobile application which will help new students navigate the institution with ease. The app dubbed Footprints can be downloaded by students and has been customised from google maps to help new students easily navigate their way across the campus. To do this, the app relies on its database that contains information of the entire campus including hostels, lecture halls, library, dining hall and various other spots.The app was developed by Sammy Gathaiya and Lazarus Korir with assistance of their lecturer Moris Kaburu.&ldquo;We wanted to offer an easy way for new students and visitors to the institution to get from one class to the next with ease, as part of their orientation,&rdquo; Gathaiya said.They team mapped out and keyed in all classes, rooms, offices and buildings in the facility as well as foot paths and routes within the institution.&ldquo;The cool thing about the app is that it not only shows you where you are and where you want to go but it also shows you possible routes to your desired destinations,&rdquo; he said.Kaburu explained that the developers have yet to have the app available in google play store, for wide download, but the App can be customised to any environment.&ldquo;Footprints App can be customised for any institution in the country. All you require is to input information about buildings and rooms in the institution and this allows the user to navigate, a town, a school or a business with ease,&rdquo; Korir explained.The team also said the app can be used to boost the country&rsquo;s tourism sector.&ldquo;Instead of using traditional maps, tourists can use the app to get around local towns and tourists sites with ease,&rdquo; Gathaiya said.
