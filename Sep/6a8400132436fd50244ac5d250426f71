NAIROBI, KENYA: The government has launched a single registry that allows members of the public to access key information on the cash transfer programmes linked to it.The web portal allows the public to access information on Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC), Older Persons Cash Transfer Programme (OPTC), Persons with Severe Disabilities Cash Transfer (PwSD-CT), Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP), and the World Food Programme&#39;s Jenga Jamii cash transfer. Speaking in Nairobi during the launch, Labour and Social protection Cabinet Secretary Phyllis Kandie said the cash transfer programmes for the vulnerable groups in the country have been implemented by different government agencies and partners hence resulting in duplication and wastage of resources.&quot;One of the main challenges that had been experienced is the double dipping where beneficiaries would be able to receive payments from two or more programmes,&quot; said CS Kandie.The single registry will provide a common platform for the implementers to cross check the data on beneficiaries, through the linkage to the Integrated Population Registration Services and eliminate multiple registrations of beneficiaries into the programme.The centralised registry will help to eliminate fraud through electronic verification of programme beneficiary&#39;s details by ensuring that only genuine beneficiaries are paid.The registry consolidates data from programme Management Information Systems (MIS) of the country&#39;s main social cash transfer programmes, into a unified beneficiary MIS that aggregates and analyses this information to support planning, coordination and accountability.Kandie said the ministry in collaboration with UNICEF is in the process of mapping social protection programmes that are implemented at the county level.&quot;The study is expected to make recommendations on how to address the gaps identified and we believe the mapping exercise will come up with key recommendations that will assist the counties to design and implement social protection programmes,&quot; she added.In his speech which was read by CS Kandie, Deputy President William Ruto said the strategy aims to reduce poverty through investing in vulnerable groups of people as a way of implementing the Social Development Goal on ending extreme poverty in all forms by 2030.World Food Programme deputy director for Kenya Paul Turnbull noted that investing in social protection is a key component underpinning any successful market economy.&quot;Evidence around the world and particularly in Africa, has shown the impact that a strong, life cycle social protection programme can have on breaking the poverty cycle,&quot; he said.
