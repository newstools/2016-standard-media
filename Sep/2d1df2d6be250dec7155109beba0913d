NAIROBI, KENYA: A new security product promising to stop stealth attacks, zero day malware has been launched.The new technology also known as the intercept x installs alongside existing endpoint security software from any vendor, immediately boosting endpoint protection by stopping malicious code before it executes. &ldquo;Using big data analytics along with our deep understanding of threat patterns, attack vectors and criminal motivations, we designed Intercept X from the ground up to recognize malicious behaviors and stop potential attacks much sooner in the kill-chain, without the need for updates or signatures,&rdquo; said Dan Schiappa, Senior Vice President of the End User Security Group at Sophos.&ldquo;IT professionals know that there is no single equation that stops all attacks, so we developed Intercept X to combine several techniques for faster identification and response that are coordinated to better support IT professionals without the need for specialized security staff.&rdquo;It combines four critical security components that IT administrators should expect from next-generation endpoint protection.Signatureless Threat and Exploit Detection: Anti-malware and anti-hacker defense that blocks zero-day, unknown and memory resident attacks and threat variants without the need for file scanningCryptoGuard: Anti-ransomware innovation that identifies and intercepts malicious encryption activity, blocks ransomware before it can lock and cripple systems and can roll back maliciously encrypted files to their pre-attack stateRoot Cause Analytics: A 360 degree visual analysis of attack events that shows where the attack came in, what it affected, where it may have stopped and recommended actions to prevent a similar attack in the futureSophos Clean: Powerful utility that hunts for and removes any trace of spyware and deeply embedded, lingering malwareAccording to ESG research, many organizations have extensively adopted advanced prevention products, such as next-gen antivirus and even more are planning to ease their way into advanced detection and response. Unfortunately, many enterprises simply lack the right level of security analytics skills or staff to perform these tasks effectually, thanks to a global, problematic shortage of cybersecurity skills. With Intercept X Sophos looks to provide a fast-track to achieving advanced protection and response capabilities while minimizing the need for specialized security consultants to administer it. In ESG Lab&rsquo;s opinion, Sophos Intercept X has made excellent progress closing many of the endpoint security gaps that still exist for organizations worldwide.&rdquo; Says Tony Palmer, senior Lab analyst at ESG.Customers and partners who participated in the public beta program experienced the next-generation protection capabilities of Sophos Intercept X, including the ability to help to eliminate the impact of ransomware by almost immediately recognizing and stopping malicious encryption activity and preventing the attack from spreading across the network. Once the threat is neutralized, affected files can be rolled back to the pre-attack state, saving considerable time, resources and money.
