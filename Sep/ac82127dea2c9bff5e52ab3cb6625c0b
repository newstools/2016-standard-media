KENYA: On June 26, 2008, in Monda Village in Busia County, James Omoto and his family were mourning his second wife, Faustine Makhokha.Early that morning, Omoto and his first wife Margaret Ouma travelled to Busia Dsitrict Hospital to collect Makhokha&rsquo;s&nbsp;body for burial at their family home. On returning at around 3pm, the vehicle carrying the body, Omoto, Ouma and other relatives was stopped by Omoto&rsquo;s two nephews &mdash; Francis Juma and John Nyongesa &mdash; who had been camping at the homestead.Juma and Nyongesa were involved in a land dispute with Omoto and insisted that Makhokha would not be buried in the compound until the matter, which had been filed in court, was resolved.Omoto alighted from the vehicle and pleaded with them to allow him bury his wife. According to Ouma, when Omoto alighted, Juma retreated to the house and came back wielding a big club with which he hit Omoto on the head.Ouma and other mourners watched helplessly as Nyongesa, as though what Juma had done was not enough, cut Omoto in the head with the panga (machete) he was carrying.Omoto staggered and fell down - unconscious. Relatives immediately unloaded the coffin bearing Makhokha&rsquo;s remains from the vehicle and rushed Omoto to the hospital.Francis Onyango, Alfred Akumu, and Stephen Odhiambo, who were among relatives who witnessed the incident, testified in support of Ouma&rsquo;s testimony.Vincent Omoto, son of Makhokha and Omoto, told the court that on the morning that incident happened, he and his father were leaving the homestead, Juma had handed them a restraining order from the advocate. The order barred the family from burying&nbsp;Makhokha on the land.During the trial, Juma defended himself saying that when he heard the funeral convoy hooting outside his house, he approached the vehicle and asked his uncle why they had chosen to pass outside his home and when his brother joined him, they demanded the hearse be diverted from their home. They both claimed that Omoto and two of his sons then alighted and attacked them, forcing them to defend themselves.Both of them were convicted and sentenced to 40 years. However, they appealed and the sentence was overturned by Kisumu Court of Appeal judges Daniel Musinga, Agnes Murgor and Stephen Kairu who sentenced them on July 29,2016 to death for murdering their uncle.
