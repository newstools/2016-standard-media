More than 200 P1 unemployed teachers in Runyenjes constituency have formed a caucus in a bid to highlight their frustrations after failing to get government employment for many years. Some of them graduated over 13 years ago and are blaming their lack of employment to alleged skewed recruitment practices and corruption within the ranks of Teachers Service Commission (TSC) officials. They said they had participated in interviews for every recruitment over the years without success. The teachers who converged at Runyenjes social hall where they were hosted by Runyenjes Central MCA Steve Simba complained they had severally been discriminated against, even in favour of those who graduated after them as a result of &lsquo;corruption&rsquo;. Joyce Wairimu who graduated from a teachers training college in 2009 expressed disillusionment after failing to secure a job in successive recruitments. &quot;I hail from Nakuru County but I am married in Embu. As a result, I am advised to seek employment from my county of birth every time I apply for recruitment,&quot; she lamented. Mureithi Kiura said as a result of the frustrations, he has chosen to engage in transport business where he is employed as a loader.&quot; Simba raised concern saying that the 5,000 teachers set to be recruited by TSC countrywide is a drop in the ocean, considering the 80,000 teacher&#39;s shortage countrywide. He also appealed to proprietors of private schools to offer fair remuneration to the teachers and pay their salaries on time.
