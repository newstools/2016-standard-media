Eveready East Africa plans to sell an 18.5-acre piece of land in Nakuru making it the latest asset the battery supplier is disposing to support its cash flows.The firm, which has issued a profit warning, has called for an extraordinary general meeting on October 6, 2016 where it will be seeking the green-light in order to sell the property and change its name to Eveready East Africa Plc. &ldquo;The company&rsquo;s levels of borrowing are unsustainable and the persistent high interest rate regime continues to hurt our business and erode shareholder value,&rdquo; said Eveready Managing Director Jackson Mutua.The company spent Sh104.1 million on finance costs last year due to its borrowing levels, which include a foreign-denominated currency component, which contributed significantly to the loss recorded in the year. &ldquo;This sale is also part of management&rsquo;s strategy to unlock funds for investment in more productive areas of the company,&rdquo; said Mr Mutua.The company&rsquo;s business model changed to a retail one with the cessation of manufacturing in 2014.The firm made a loss of Sh77 million last year and it expects to widen this loss by at least 25 per cent this year. It has resorted to selling off its assets among them factory equipment, land, staff houses as well as vehicles assigned to its former managing director to help it deal with its cash flow problems.Firms resort to selling assets when in dire financial strain. If they are critical assets for their operations, they enter in sale and lease back arrangements that allow them to rent them back for their use.Mutua said the Nakuru property has been largely idle since the company closed its manufacturing facility in 2014. But it did not disclose how much it expects to earn from the sale.&ldquo;A feasibility study conducted on the property failed to give an unequivocal go-ahead for the development of a mixed use complex. Investing in a distribution centre in Nairobi complements our retail model and eliminates our property leasing costs,&rdquo; said Mutua.The firm said it is pursuing various initiatives as part of its five-year strategy aimed at increasing the size of its business through diversification and increasing efficiency in its business processes.The company has also introduced its own brand of washing powder detergent, Everclean, to the Kenyan consumer. Mutua said the firm&rsquo;s strength continues to lie in its distribution infrastructure.&ldquo;We intend to continue to leverage on this strength in order to grow our business,&rdquo; he said.
