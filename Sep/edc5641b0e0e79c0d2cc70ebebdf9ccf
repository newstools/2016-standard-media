Anxiety has gripped politicians in Rift Valley eyeing the Jubilee Party ticket. Their fears are founded on claims that the party leadership has already drawn a list of preferred candidates for various elective seats in the next general election.President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto have publicly stated that the new party will not condone the culture of preferred candidates and/or direct nominations. The latest round of deep suspicion and bitter competition pits elected leaders against aspirants &mdash; divisions that threaten party unity. The Jubilee leadership has proposed holding primaries three months before the August 8, 2017 General Election. The aim is to provide sufficient time for healing and reconciliation as party insiders say priority is being given to assuring all aspirants that the process would be free and fair.But Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi on Friday said credible sources within Jubilee had confided in him that already, a list of preferred candidates has been drawn up ahead of the nominations.&ldquo;I feel sorry for political aspirants for various seats who are dreaming of clinching the Jubilee Party ticket. My highly-placed friends in the party have been coming to me secretly to tell me the party&rsquo;s top secrets. They confided in me that the new party has already prepared the list of their preferred candidates,&rdquo; the Baringo Senator said.Rigging fearsHis sentiments lend credence to utterances by Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter, a&nbsp; confidante of Deputy President William Ruto, who has on more than one occasion declared that he would determine the next Kericho governor in next year&rsquo;s General Election.Keter&rsquo;s gubernatorial project is believed to be former National Social Security Fund (NSSF) Managing Trustee Richard Langat, who recently secured a handsome send-off package from NSSF.Emurua-Dikir MP Johana Ng&rsquo;eno cited himself as a living example of how rigging could backfire on Jubilee.&ldquo;In 2012, I was rigged out of my victory in the United Republican Party (URP) nomination exercise and I joined Kenya National Congress Party. I emerged victorious. The same thing will happen if parties will have preferred candidates. The people will vote for the leaders they want,&rdquo; said Ng&rsquo;eno.The fiery MP said political parties are like donkeys used to deliver goods as no one cares much about the animals afterwards.Moi explained that the independence party had rejected an invitation to join JP after realising that the party would not practice internal party democracy.&ldquo;Kanu is ready to field candidates for various seats across the country and that is why there is no reason at all to join Jubilee Party. The new party will not practice internal democracy,&rdquo; Moi said.The Kanu boss petitioned the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to hasten the registration of new voters using the biometric system.&ldquo;The country is moving to the biometric system of voting which will seal loopholes for election rigging. We are therefore asking Kenyans to come out in their numbers to register as voters,&rdquo; Moi said.He made the remarks at Kiptenden village in Bureti Constituency during the funeral service of Francis Kipsang Marisin, the father of Kanu politician Paul Sang.Moi dismissed Deputy President William Ruto as a politician suffering from a &ldquo;bankruptcy of ideas&rdquo;, adding that his 2022 dream of ascending to the presidency after President Uhuru Kenyatta hangs on God&rsquo;s grace.&ldquo;There is a story being peddled around to the Kalenjin community that they should persevere and support Ruto and reap from the jobs and other opportunities which will come in 2022. No one lives on a dream. Kenyans require employment opportunities, tarmac roads, health facilities and good schools among other facilities now,&rdquo; Moi said.Kanu Secretary General Nick Salat told the Jubilee Party to brace itself for a bruising court battle for appropriating Kanu colours.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was surprised when they undressed Kanu and stole our colours. We are aggrieved as Kanu after Jubilee took over our colours; if Jubilee leaders want to come back to Kanu, they should just come. Do not use the back door to enter Kanu by stealing our colours,&rdquo; said Salat.But Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi said he was confident that the Jubilee nominations would be above board as the primaries will be conducted by the IEBC.Sudi, who early this year campaigned against Jubilee during the March 7 Kericho by-election, said he was in Jubilee and supports the re-election of President Kenyatta and Ruto.&ldquo;We are all supporting the Jubilee party decision, most people thought that because I supported a Kanu candidate during the Kericho by-election, then I will not drum up support for Jubilee Party but they are mistaken,&rdquo; said Sudi.He said hopefuls should strive hard to win the confidence of the electorate.&ldquo;The Deputy President has never preferred a candidate in the primaries and aspirants should strive to woo voters as they will be the ones to decide,&rdquo; he said.In the 2013 elections, some of the aspirants in the North Rift who were perceived to be close to the DP lost during the URP nominations.Lake Victoria North Water Services Board member Isaac Maiyo, a parliamentary aspirant for Turbo on a Jubilee ticket, said those who will be elected will be the leaders that the public want.Maiyo, who was previously Ruto&rsquo;s Eldoret North Constituency Development Fund chairman, said he will seek the JP ticket because he believes the party unites Kenyans and gives&nbsp; aspirants a platform to woo the electorate. &ldquo;I am not worried about being short-changed because with the structures in place, I believe that the political vehicle I am using will give me victory over those who prefer to vie as independent candidates,&rdquo; he said.Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto of CCM said he was confident that his party would reap big following the merger of the Jubilee affiliate parties.&ldquo;Let us be frank, do you think Jubilee Party is willing to let go of the likes of Adan Duale, Kipchumba Murkomen, Kithure Kindiki and other loyalists during party nominations? Those competing for the same positions with them under the same ticket should rethink their position,&rdquo; he said.But Molo MP Jacob Macharia said the incumbent and aspirants gunning for the JP ticket would be given an equal chance.Free and fair&ldquo;Yes, there are fears among leaders that the nominations will not be free and fair but we need to understand that as politicians we must fight for those positions and not wait to be declared as preferred candidates by the party leadership,&rdquo; he said.National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) Chairman Lee Kinyanjui, who is eyeing the Nakuru gubernatorial seat, said he expected the nominations to be fair. He warned that any attempt to impose candidates on the people would backfire.- Stories by Karanja Njoroge, Steve Mkawale and Nikko Tanui
