In Transmara, Narok County is Dikir Nicosounds Band, which has established itself as an entertainment force to reckon with.Headed by Nicholas Kipyegon Koech, better known by his fans as Kipyegon Dikir, the band handles roadshows, live performances and private parties. Kipyegon, 30, is a jack of all trades. He is a drummer, guitarist, lead vocalist and back-up vocalist. He has lived from hand to mouth after he was forced to drop out of school while in class two.&ldquo;When I left school, I was employed as a goat herder earning a paltry Sh1,500 per month,&rdquo; he says.Kipyegon would take on various other jobs to survive, moving from one town to the next and it was while he was in Roret that he developed a passion for music.His stay in Roret, was however, cut short by the post election violence and he had to return home and started dancing for Makiche Band while learning how to play a drum and guitar on his own.&ldquo;I started singing in 2012 and in 2013, I went to Mombasa to play drums for Makiche Band, which used to stage live performances at Bamburi Restaurant. It was my first time to play drums and from then I have never looked back,&rdquo; he says.That same year, Kipyegon left Makiche Band and went on to start his own band. &ldquo;My dream is to grow talents in Transmara and offer hope to aspiring musicians especially those who believe you can only be accomplished by starting big. This is where people go wrong. You can start from humble beginnings and make great strides,&rdquo; he says.Kipyegon says getting acceptance from fans is the first important stride towards success in this field.&ldquo;During the performance, I do not sit back stage as other musicians do. I directly interact with the crowd. This is how I get to know what to give my fans,&rdquo; he says.He also believes in learning from those already established in the sector.
