KAKAMEGA: Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba move to join Labour Party of Kenya (LPK) elicits mixed reaction among top ODM leadership while some welcomed him to work with Cord coalition; others termed the move as inconsequential.It has been three months of waiting for Ababu to unveil LPK. He resigned in July as ODM Secretary General together with Funyula MP Paul Otuoma (vice chairman) and Sirisia MP John Waluke (ODM Chairman Bungoma County). Otuoma has maintained he is still in ODM while Waluke jumped to Jubilee party which was merged recently.At the time of their resignation, the three lawmakers cited being frustrated by ODM leadership and accused the party of trivializing their complaints.Their resignation was heavily criticised by ODM leadership and accused of being Jubilee moles in Cord.A week after their resignations, a series of political rallies was planned by ODM party leader Raila Odinga in Western region to counter their resignation.Raila pitched tent in Budalang&rsquo;i and Funyula constituencies for a day during his five day tour of the region.Funyula lawmaker says LPK is in CORD coalition and he was invited to attend its 18th anniversary and rebranding which took place on Thursday in Nairobi.&quot;LPK is a party that has been in existence for years. Attending a function does not mean we have defected. I also attended ANC launch months ago,&#39;&#39; said Otuoma.When reached for a comment, Ababu said he would respond later because he was busy.In a letter seen by Standard, LPK Secretary General Peter Kubebea said the party has completed three month process of rebranding, refreshing and strengthening of its leadership.&quot;LPK will be officially unveiled at a dinner event bringing together leaders and delegates across the country. Labour party is now ready and raring to compete aggressively and effectively on the Kenyan political scene,&#39;&#39; read in part.ODM Chairman and Suba MP John Mbadi said he welcomes LPK move to rebrand and work with CORD noting that the coalition needs more parties as they plan for 2017 general elections.&quot;Politics is dynamic. LPK joining CORD is acceptable. Ababu is one of us and seems he has abandoned the Third Force idea which is a wise move. I don&#39;t think we should be harsh on him. I would hesitate to dismiss him,&#39;&#39; stressed Mbadi.Mbadi said remarks by Jubilee leaders led by Deputy President William Ruto when Ababu resigned were in bad faith.&quot;Ababu has leant the tricks Jubilee were playing, they didn&#39;t mean well for him and it is good he has rethought his steps and LPK is a genuine initiative. He is welcomed to work with us because I know we shall have a major coalition next year,&#39;&#39; added the Suba legislator.Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong wished him well but insists Ababu was in a better political position while in ODM adding that he doesn&#39;t see him working with CORD.&quot;I wish him well let him try where he believes he can make it. Ababu already betrayed ODM and CORD. There is little he will bring on board because the vacuum he created has been filled,&rdquo; said Ojaamong.Butere lawmaker and Kakamega County ODM Secretary General Andrew Toboso said LPK&rsquo;s rebranding is inconsequential at the moment stating that political formation in the country is already complete.&quot;Key players in the political arena have already taken position. LPK will be struggling and when one forms a party, he should indicate where the support base is. Forming a party in this area adds no value,&#39;&#39;.Toboso further dismissed LPK chances of working with CORD saying it would be difficult the party to form a merger with Amani National Congress or Ford Kenya parties which are making inroads in the region.&quot;LPK will not add any value in CORD. The coalition is stronger at the moment without LPK,&#39;&#39; added Toboso.
