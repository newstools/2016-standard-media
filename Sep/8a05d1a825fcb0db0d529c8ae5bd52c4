As the clock ticks towards the 2017 General Election, Jubilee Party and the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) have intensified their hunt for votes, especially in counties perceived to be undecided.Narok and Kajiado counties have emerged as political battle grounds for the two major rivals that, in the recent past, have intensified their vote hunts by reaching out to opinion leaders from the Maasai community. President Uhuru Kenyatta and CORD leader Raila Odinga have employed different strategies to reach out to the Maa community, whose voting pattern in the 2013 General Election suggests the votes are up for grabs.For decades, the struggle for land rights has always defined the tone of Maasai politics and leadership in the two counties.At a crossroadsBut with the demise of the legendary politician William ole Ntimama - who played a major role in championing rights of the community and helped them chart their political path every election year - the Maasai people are at a crossroads.During Ntimama&rsquo;s burial at his Motonyi farm in Narok County on Wednesday, it was evident that the scramble for the Masaai vote will be more intense and vicious, as the country approaches the polls.Political pundits say the political spat between President Kenyatta and Raila at Ntimama&rsquo;s burial was a clear sign that the Maasai vote was crucial to the two leaders.&ldquo;In the last General Election in Kajiado County, Uhuru garnered 138,851 votes against Raila&rsquo;s 117,856 votes. Statistically, the county is torn right in the middle between Jubilee and CORD,&rdquo; observed Dr Philip Chebunet, a political science lecturer at University of Eldoret.Prior to his death, Ntimama had shown all indications that the Maasai community was ready to support President Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election.On August 8, less than a month before his death, Ntimama led a delegation of Maasai leaders from Narok and Laikipia in announcing that they were prepared to join the Jubilee Party en-masse.The CORD leadership, however, is convinced that Ntimama was misled by his handlers into entering into a pact with the President and hoped to convince him to change his mind and return &ldquo;home&rdquo;.According to those close to the former Heritage minister, he was planning to call a community meeting at the famous Suswa grounds soon to drum up support for Jubilee Party.The leaders, who included Narok Senator Stephen ole Ntutu, Laikipia East MP Mathew Lempurkel and Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Nge&rsquo;no, said their announcement was a culmination of discussions within the Maasai community.According to Ntimama&rsquo;s daughter Lydia Masikonte, her dad had planned a major political rally in Narok where he was scheduled to officially announce their decision to rally behind the party of his choice.Ntimama was quoted in a section of the press then declaring that he would visit all regions with Maa speaking people to rally support for Jubilee. But the Opposition, led by Raila, insists Ntimama was still a member of CORD and that his visit to State House was informed by the need for development for his people.During Ntimama&rsquo;s burial, Raila said the Maa leader had affirmed his position in ODM and dispelled fears that he had decamped to Jubilee.Some ODM officials acknowledged Ntimama&rsquo;s huge political influence, but said his demise has left the community to decide on its own.Historical land injustices&ldquo;Though Ntimama had expressed his desire to unite the community to bolster chances of President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election, it will now vote for either him or Raila,&rdquo; says Narok ODM Chairman Charles Nampaso.Nampaso said the community has a bond with the former premier who they believe will fight historical land injustices that have been bedeviling the community.Days after Ntimama and other Maasai leaders met the President at State House, Raila hosted another delegation of Maasai leaders from Narok and Kajiado, led by former ICT Principal Secretary Joseph Tiampati at Orange House.Not all Jubilee leaders, however, believe in kingpins. Narok North MP Moitalel ole Kenta said it was high time the community rose above tribal kingpins and eye national politics.&ldquo;The era of political kingpins is over. All leaders are equal. We do not require tribal chieftains as it has dragged us behind. The Maasai should now play national politics,&rdquo; says Kenta.
