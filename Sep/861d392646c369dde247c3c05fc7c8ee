&nbsp;NAIROBI: Lack of awareness and knowledge is what is hampering growth of domestic tourism according to Jumia Travel Report released recently. Cyrus Onyiego, the Country Manager for Jumia Travel while addressing the media during the launch of the report said the fact that &quot;travel is still viewed as a luxurious affair, simply because the consumer has minimal knowledge on the product,&quot; is also another challenge.&quot;I call upon stakeholders to come up with customized and personalized products for the market, keeping in mind the culture, lifestyle and budget needs for local travelers,&quot; said Onyiego.The report also indicated a rising need for hotel owners and tour operators to design products and packages for the emerging group of millennial travelers who may not be keen on luxury as compared to convenience, budget and flexibility.According to Eugene Too, the Online Revenue Manager for The Panari Hotel, the lower gap in the current millennial bracket is very clear on what they are looking for; fun and adventure.&quot;It is therefore important for providers to offer matching facilities and amenities if they want to capture this growing market,&quot; said Mr Too.His comments were reiterated by Alfrida Boinett, the CEO - Private Collections, commenting that, &quot;this group of travelers are the future of the industry and therefore any brand keen on building loyalty must be ready to accommodate them and grow with them.&quot;Boinett, also observed a new trend in family travel.&quot;Families want to travel as one, stay together and share experiences without unnecessary restrictions; this has brought about a new demand for self-catering cottages and family friendly packages,&quot; he added.Rather than trying to replicate products for diverse users, both panelists urged hotel owners to adapt to changing needs and target to satisfy personal needs for their guests.The report revealed that 51 percent of travelers are family, while slightly more than half of local bookings on Jumia Travel consist of either nuclear or extended families on holiday, only 13 percent are made of friends traveling as a group.Further, the report indicates that single or individual travelers are equally popular, while business travelers take up 23 percent of the total bookings.Most interesting however, is the observation that men are more popular e-travel consumers than women, with the ratio of male travelers almost doubling that of women at 64 percent as compared to women at 36 percent.A comparative report on Nigeria defies the (Kenyan) family law however, with individual travelers totaling to 65 percent, while only a meager six percent travel as family.Coast region leads as the most popular destination for Kenyans at 30 per cent, while still maintaining the same numbers at 30 per cent in the number of room nights registered on the booking platform.Nairobi follows closely behind, with a good 29 per cent of local travelers headed for the city&#39;s room nights, which occupies 27 per cent of the rooms available on Jumia Travel.Naivasha and Nakuru, which are both increasingly growing as conference centers as well as major escape destinations for leisure and short holidays, take up a combined percentage of 17 per cent in visitor numbers. The region contributes 10 per cent of room nights on Jumia Travel.Kisumu and Eldoret are marked out as growing centers partly because of Lake Victoria as an attraction and also as an entry point for cross border travel.Other factors such as devolution and destination awareness campaigns also contribute to the growing attention the two towns are currently enjoying.Mount Kenya accounts for seven per cent of the nation&#39;s total room nights, while taking up five per cent of local travelers.As one may expect in Kenya, mobile payments is the most popular mode of payment for guests who prefer prepayment (paying before arrival).Kenyans however are seen not to favor swiping their cards as this only takes up about fourteen percent 14 per cent of the prepayment chart, while other means (cheque, EFT and corporate payments) account for twenty six percent 26 per cent.Desktop computers still carry the day as the preferred gadget for completing bookings at a remarkable 83 percent still prefer to complete their bookings via desktop computers. Seventeen percent search and book on mobile gadgets.The online booking website, which recently re-branded from &quot;Jovago&quot; has analyzed booking trends on it&#39;s website for the period between 2015/2016, generated by hundreds of travelers on the platform.jwanzala@standardmedia.co.ke
