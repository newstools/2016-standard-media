The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has rescheduled summons of 15 MCAs to Monday.This paves the way for MCAs to debate an impeachment motion against Governor Nderitu Gachagua this morning. There was fear that the summons over last week&#39;s brawl would scuttle the impeachment motion which requires a two-thirds majority in the 47-member assembly to sail through.EACC Director Jackson Mue Thursday said: &quot;We have since rescheduled their summons. When we sent out the invitations we were not aware of the motion and we have accepted that they appear on Monday.&quot;Assembly speaker Mwangi Mugo had written to the commission requesting that the summons be rescheduled to ensure all MCAs are in the House today to debate the motion.Some MCAs had read malice, saying the summons were meant to deny them the two-thirds threshold.House majority leader Duncan Gituanja had claimed EACC was being used by the governor to jeopardise the motion.Fifteen MCAs had received summons to appear before EACC, with Mr Gituanja saying the members in question had written to EACC confirming that they had received the summons.&quot;They have requested that they be allowed to appear on any other day, but not on Friday,&quot; Mr Gituanja said.Speaking at the funeral service of the late James Gathogo, a former Gakawa&nbsp; Councillor in Kieni East, MCAs vowed to to push through with the impeachment motion.Mr Gituanja alleged that some members had been receiving threats, while others were being followed by unknown people.&quot;We are a hundred per cent sure it will sail through despite threats and intimidation,&quot;Kirimukuyu MCA James Kibira said.Kenya National Union of Teachers Nyeri branch Secretary General Mutahi Kahiga said the governor should have demonstrated leadership by engaging them in dialogue to iron out the differences without resulting to political muscle-flexing.He said MCAs had a constitutional right to impeach Gachagua if they have enough grounds.&quot;As teachers, we are fully behind the move as the governor has never done anything in the education sector,&quot; said Mr Kahiga.Kieni MP Kanini Kega said he had on several occasions tried to arbitrate over the matter, but the governor adamantly refused negotiations dismissing him as a junior.&quot;It is unfortunate arrogance has brought us here,&quot; the lawmaker said adding that the scenario threatens to grind operations in the county to a halt.Nonetheless Mr Gachagua has an opportunity to defend himself before the Senate if the motion succeeds or he can seek recourse in court.Efforts by other Nyeri leaders including Senator Mutahi Kagwe to settle the matter through dialogue have hit a wall, with MCAs insisting they can only do so if Mr Gachagua agrees to return the alleged misused funds.
