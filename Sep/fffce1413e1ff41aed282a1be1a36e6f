Forget the huge fuel guzzlers cars that have long been associated with the big politicians in the country, with they dynamism of time, need for speed and razzmatazz that comes with politics, the next elections will be a battle right from the air.Be it speed or&nbsp;the ultimate political statement, the political &#39;big boys&#39; are increasingly using helicopters as their preferred means of transport. And to ensure their preparedness for the 2017 political duel, most of the top&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;have&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;top of the range helicopters that include the eurocopters as 350 to the powerful Bell 407 that ensure reliability of both speed and stamina in what could arguably be the most grueling polls ever in Kenya.In the last two years alone President Kenyatta, his deputy William Ruto, opposition&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;and CORD co principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Amani National Congress (ANC) leader&nbsp;Musalia Mudavadi and Peter Kenneths have&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;the helicopters popularly known as &#39;choppers&#39; and have already put to test.This is on top of the list that includes Kanu supremo Gideon Moi, retired President Mwai Kibaki, Embu senator Lenny Kivuti, former ministers Simeon Nyachae and&nbsp;Nicholas Biwott.Whereas President Kenyatta had earlier&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;one in the run up to the 2012 elections, according to a source at Wilson, another&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;was added to his list last year.It is however his deputy that has taken into the acquisition jointly with other&nbsp;sources claiming that he has three Aerospatiale 350B3 Ecureuil eurocopters that could help the newly launched Jubilee Party comb the nooks and crannies of the country&nbsp;in search of votes.Last year both Raila and Kalonzo bought a bell 407 and AS&nbsp;350B3 eurocopter respectively. However, Wiper&nbsp;leader&#39;s&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;5Y- DKK which had been chartered by Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) ruling party in Tanzania during the election campaigns tragically crashed in October 2015 killing the pilot and three passengers including outspoken parliamentary aspirant Deo Filikunjombe.The former vice President has been compensated by the insurer for the crashing of the chopper at Selous Game Reserve enroute the town of Ludewa in southwest Tanzania.&nbsp;It is however not clear if he is in the process of&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;another ahead of the elections.According to Rotorspot, a website that monitors the civil helicopters registered worldwide and their histories including &nbsp;those which are still active and those that have crashed, there are more than 153, 480 helicopters in their latest update as at 31-Aug-2016.Rotorspot indicates that there are 131&nbsp;choppers&nbsp;both active and those written off in Kenya and about 61 of those planes are privately owned including those&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;by the &#39;big boys&#39; of politics.The latest in the fleet of&nbsp;choppers&nbsp;is the entrance of two AS 350 eurocopters under a company associated with the Deputy President that arrived last month and&nbsp; 5Y-PPS owned by Kibwezi West MP Patrick Musimba whose assembly was completed early this month.Other dignitaries who own the&nbsp;choppers&nbsp;include the retired President Mwai Kibaki whose 5Y FWE was&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;over two years ago under a company, businessman Jimmy Wanjigi&nbsp; 5Y JWJ.Also with the&nbsp;choppers&nbsp;are former ministers Nicholas Biwot (5Y HNB), Simeon Nyachae (5Y HSN) registered under Aircraft Leasing Services, and former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth who owns two Bell 407&nbsp;choppers, 5Y PK1 and 5Y PKZ.Others are politicians former Mathira MP Eprahim Maina who is also running for the Nyeri gubernatorial seat with two Bells 5Y PSM and 5Y MNW a Bell 206B (4638) manufactured in 2006, media owners SK Macharia and Kass FM owner Joshua Chepkwony also own AS 350B2 rotor planes.Chepkwony owns 5Y HJK while Macharia is the proud owner of 5Y DSB and 5Y SGM. Former army chief of staff Julius Karangi owns a AS350B3&nbsp; that was&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;more than four years ago.According to a pilot who sought anonymity, the flying in by politicians have increased significantly over a period of five years.&quot;Initially, it was only for the exclusive few who would get in to Wilson Airport and ask to hire a&nbsp;chopper, nowadays there are several governors, MPs and even political aspirants who book to fly. Some even call in sometime&nbsp;late at night or drive into the airport and ask to have a&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;to fly immediately,&quot; said the pilot.He said that at any given time there are so many&nbsp;choppers&nbsp;which will be airborne due to the hire by politicians locally.However, the&nbsp;choppers&nbsp;do not only ferry politicians, beyond the political activities, they are a business venture that span tourism, filming and medical evacuation services alongside luxury business trips that engage the now popular speedy and luxurious means of transport.Captain Evans Sigilai, a longtime helicopter pilot, says politicians are lately taking a significant percentage of&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;hires but notes that tourism and medical evacuations were also part of the demanding jobs that the helicopters do.&quot;Currently, we get so many politicians hiring the planes for political meetings and we also have medical evacuations and filming been done by the&nbsp;choppers, unlike in the past where it was seen as a tool for luxury.&nbsp;It is it increasingly becoming a necessity for those who want speed and comfort,&quot; said Capt Sigilai.His long time colleague Capt Thomas Samoei, a&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;is hired at sh150,000 &ndash; 170,000 per hour and cost only charged on flight time and not when the plane is on ground.The popular brands of the France made aerospatiale 350B3e Ecureuil eurocopters that had their first flight 1974, cost&nbsp;sh230million for ex-factory price, but the cost of transportation, assembly and insurance pushes the cost up to Sh300million.The Bell 407 is a high performance&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;with the ability to cruise at 133 kts/246 km/h.Its spacious cabin has five club-passenger seats with an additional passenger seat in the cockpit in single pilot operations.The Kenyans&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;craze&nbsp;starred in the recent general elections in Uganda and Tanzania with five Kenyans hired in the contest in October between President Jonh Pombe Magufuli and his rival Edward Lowassa.Of particular interest in&nbsp;that craze is Kivuti&#39;s&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;5Y- HKK that flew in both Magufuli and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni&#39;s team.According to Captain Samoei, a&nbsp;helicopter consumes fuel worth Sh30,000 per hour of jet A-1 fuel in an hour while parking per night is at Sh10,000 and&nbsp;Sh1000 for every landing they make.&quot;Depending on the experience of the pilot, the insurance for a&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;ranges between Sh8-10million, they charge more if the pilot&nbsp;have few hours,&quot; said Captain Samoei who together with Sigilai are ex-airforce pilot who have flown for over 25 years.Not only&nbsp;choppersIt is not only choppers in the air that are owned by politicians, Turkana senator John Munyes owns a fixed wing Cessna plane, which he uses to fly between Nairobi and his Turkana county often.The six-seater Cessna U206 (registration 5Y-MJK) was manufactured in 1979 and registered as a private plane by the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority.
