&nbsp;Wastepaper baskets are essential items for most rooms, yet they usually get forgotten.&nbsp; When designing and decorating your rooms, factor in the size and type of wastepaper basket that you will require.&nbsp; I have a hard time finding a wastepaper basket that I like and usually the ones that attract my eyes are so highly-priced that I put off the thought of purchasing one and settle to keep my old ordinary looking plastic bin.Take time to invest in an elegant wastepaper basket even though it may come at an extra cost or simply settle for a functional, simple clean plastic bin in the right colour and you will be amazed at how it will brighten up your room.Other materials for wastepaper bin options include leather, chrome, wicker, wooden or various types of plastics. Childrens&rsquo; furniture shops now have bins with popular cartoon characters or wooden bins crafted with colourful children friendly moulds such as butterflys or cars for the boys.Bin colourSelect a bin colour in the accent colour in your room. This is usually the third colour in your room that balances the background colour and the second colour. For example, the background colour will be used in the biggest proportion such as on the walls.&nbsp;This may be a light colour such as soft cream or pastel yellows or greens. The monotony of the background colour is broken by a second colour which can be complementary or contrasting.&nbsp; A third colour balances the colours and provides a surprise element to the eye. Your wastepaper basket should be in the third colour which is an accent colour.Bin maintenanceJust because it carries dirt does not mean that your bin needs to look like dirt. Take care of your bin by always lining it with a plastic paper bag so that you protect it from the dirt and grim from the waste collected.This is especially important for a kitchen bin as it usually has wet waste and decaying food remains. A lid on your kitchen bin is especially important so as to lock in any possible smells.Frequent washing of the bin is essential if you are to keep it in tip-top condition and daily disposal of kitchen waste into a bigger outdoor rubbish bin is necessary so as not to attract insects such as ants and cockroaches indoors.&nbsp;In countries with advanced waste disposal systems, the waste is separated into those that can be recycled and gabbage that can be used as compost.LocationPosition your waste disposal bin in a convenient location away from walk-paths. This can be under the sink in the kitchen or there could be a pullout cupboard in modern kitchen cabinets.Place the bin in a convenient corner such as under a table at a home office or behind the door in the bedrooms and add cheer when you are disposing your waste.
