Police had been waiting for them for hours.Police said they were investigating incitement claims&nbsp;among other issues .Others expected to record statements over incitement are MPs Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), James Bett (Kesses) and Tiren Silas (Moiben), police said.Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery had ordered they be questioned saying they risked arrest if they failed to record the statements. He said the six incited the public to protest against the university&#39;s management.The politicians wanted Professor Isaac Kosgey, not Ayiro, appointed because he topped interviews.Mandago requested prayers during a church event in Eldoret on Monday saying &ldquo;as human beings we are bound to make mistakes&quot;.They later said at no time did they declare that &#39;outsiders&#39; were not wanted at the University.&quot;This is a misconception created which we wish to correct. At no time did we say or imply that we wanted our own to lead the University. We regret the fact that we have been branded tribalists, which we are not,&quot; they said in a joint statement to the media.The governors reiterated their earlier stand that they stood for merit in the appointment of the next VC and demanded that the recruitment process be immediately made public to end the ongoing speculations.They added that their presence at the University was to quell tensions that had swelled between the administration and employees who had staged a demonstration at the institution.&quot;We wish to state that we did not go to Moi University to do anything else but to quell a demonstration and confrontations that had already broken out. This is something Kenyans are not being told,&quot; they said.The Governors challenged Cabinet Secretary, Dr Fred Matiang&#39;i and the University Council to make public the outcome of the interviews conducted for the VC position at the institution saying the delay to release the results was the cause of tensions
