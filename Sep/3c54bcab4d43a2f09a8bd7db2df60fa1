On June 16, 2010 Doris (not her real name) was on her way to a flour mill in Kombwe Market, Kisumu County when she met a teacher from her school whom she only knew as Bon.Bon asked her where she was going and the 14-year-old, class six pupil did not hesitate to let him know her destination. He asked her to go with him to her house and was rather adamant until she agreed. However, once Doris got into the house Bon locked it from outside and when she looked around the house, she came face to face with Hezron Ngutu who is a teacher at Choyo Primary School.Ngutu grabbed her hand and pulled her to the bedroom where he removed her clothes and raped her.After the ordeal Bon, opened the door and released her and Doris proceeded to the flour mill before returning home where she reported the incident to her mother.The sexual assault was then reported to Doris&rsquo;s school master and she was taken to Kombwe District Hospital and a report of the incident was made at the police station.Kombwe District Hospital clinical officer Paul Owiti examined and testified that on June 18, he conducted a physical examination of Doris and observed bruises on her and laceration on her hymen.He concluded that she was defiled and also ascertained that according to her parents she was only 14-years-old.Ngutu was arrested and arraigned in court charged with defiling a minor.Patricia Achieng and Dereck Ouma, both class five and four pupils at Jonyo Primary School, testified that they were herding cows near Bon&rsquo;s house when they saw Doris enter his house, after which he locked her in.The two children told the court that Ngutu and Doris were locked in the house for about 15 minutes before Bon let her out. They said Bon and Ngutu then left with Doris to the flour mill.In his defence, Ngutu insisted that the offense was a fabrication and offered an alibi saying he left the school at 4pm and headed straight to his aunt Agnes Milo&rsquo;s hotel where he assisted her serve customers till 10pm.His aunt also testified in his defence and confirmed that Ngutu spent his evening serving customers at her hotel in Kombwe market.The court, however, dismissed his alibi and sentence him to 20 years in prison. Ngutu immediately launched an appeal contesting the lower court&rsquo;s ruling.His appeal however, flopped when appellate judges, David Maraga, Daniel Musinga, and Stephen Kairu dismissed it and upheld the court&rsquo;s findings.
