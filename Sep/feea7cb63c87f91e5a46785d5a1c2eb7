Easter Elliene Kojwang is fond of encouraging those close to her to eat healthy wholesome foods and live active lifestyles.It this passion she has for healthy living that led her to establish Eastnat, a company that processes and packages wholesome foods. She currently sells ghee, peanut butter and honey. &ldquo;I wanted to play a role in helping eradicate lifestyle diseases that have become prevalent in our society. After all, happiness does not come from doing easy work but from the afterglow of satisfaction that comes after the achievement of a difficult task that demanded our best,&rdquo; she says.Kojwang says the idea of making Eastnat peanut butter, from peanuts harvested locally, came up in 2015 and she immediately ventured into the business. Honey comes from beekeepers in Baringo while she is dependent on dairy farmers for her ghee ingredients.So far, Kojwang has used social media platforms to market her products and her client base has been steadily growing.Her products are cost effective and affordable with one kg of honey retailing at Sh600, 800g of peanut butter at Sh450 and ghee at Sh900 a litre. She also packs her products in smaller portions that include 500g, 250g and half a litre.Her monthly turnover ranges between Sh90,000 to Sh150,000 and Eastnat is now approaching the growth phase of business. She hopes to realise a 100 per cent growth and more within the next one year.&ldquo;Growth is paramount for every venture and I look forward to scale up volume of production to enable us meet our product&rsquo;s ever-growing demand,&rdquo; she said.Apart from supplying hotels and big institutions, Kojwang plans to open up a store that will stock a range of organic products both from Eastnat Limited and from other small companies.
