KERICHO, KENYA: Small scale tea growers are proposing radical changes to the management of Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA) run factories so as to reduce the management cost and increase earnings of the farmers. In a meeting dubbed Silibwet Declaration over the weekend, more than 300 farmer representatives from 14 KTDA factories in Bomet and Kericho counties said the management cost was eating into their earnings. Led by Tealand Smallholder Tea growers Farmers Association (TESTEFA) interim chairman Richard Cheruiyot, the farmers said the numbers of directors per factory should be reduced. Cheruiyot said seven directors was too much proposing that the number should be cut to three as a matter of urgency.&quot;A huge percentage of the tea returns is going towards the management of the industry at the expense of the farmers earnings. Many of us have become slaves to KTDA and it is not because of the fault of the farmers and we now want these changes immediately so that we can start enjoying the fruits of being tea growers,&quot; said Cheruiyot.
