I will sit with the judges to identify what went wrong so that we can do it right,&rdquo; he said.Defiance of court orders, especially by Parliament and the Executive: The judge admitted that the problem might sometimes stem from the judicial officers issuing decisions, and that he would engage with the different arms of Government to explain the need to obey the orders.Minority rights&ldquo;We will go by what the law says. If the action they claim to be their right has been outlawed, then we will not allow it.

In fact my understanding of the Constitution is that this are matters which should be finalised within a year so that the country moves on.&rdquo;Role of JSC in administration:&rdquo;In administrative matters, you don&rsquo;t have to rush to court. There could be an issue why a matter has not been dealt with.&rdquo;
