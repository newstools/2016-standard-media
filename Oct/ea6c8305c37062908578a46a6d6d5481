NAIROBI, KENYA: Kenyans on Twitter(KOT) did not stop asking President Uhuru Kenyatta and Jacob Zuma to solve visa issue between Kenya and South Africa during the latter&rsquo;s three day visit ending today, WednesdayThey also called upon President Zuma to ensure Kenyans in South Africa are treated equally without harassment. Using the trending hashtag #ZumaInKenya, KOT urged the two Presidents to fast-track implementation, and to ensure that these policy changes are implemented with greater urgency to suit Kenyans visiting South Africa.Kenya wants the cost of South African visas to be reduced by at least 30 per cent from the current $71 (Sh7,100) to $49(Sh4,900), and insists on visa exemptions for Kenyans with diplomatic passports.This will allow Kenyan businessmen and students studying in South Africa, and in neighbouring countries of Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia to travel easily.Kenya also wants South Africa to issue a 10-year multiple-entry visa for frequent business travelers and academics and to remove the transit visa requirement for travelers passing through South African airports.In May, the two countries agreed to the issues and many Kenyans feel that this is the right time for implementation.@Wakili_Ochieng: @UKenyatta ensure you include visa to South Africa in your agenda when meeting Jacob Zuma.
