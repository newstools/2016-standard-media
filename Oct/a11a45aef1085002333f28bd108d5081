NAIROBI, KENYA: Jumia Travel is seeking to further empower its hotel partners across all markets with top-notch technology by unveiling the web extranet, a web version of the previously launched extranet app on android. The tool allows hotel managers to confirm and view their incoming Jumia Travel reservations, secured access to necessary guest information and ability to change their rates and update availability on real time basis, from any connected location. According to Charles de Moucheron, Chief Operating Officer, the portal is working on direct integration with existing partner hotel systems to manage bookings, update rates and availability. &ldquo;After integrating the first channel managers earlier in the year, we are now integrating multiple hospitality software solutions for our hotels partners so as to improve and simplify operations. The Web Extranet is built on the latest technology that delivers the shortest loading time currently available in the market. This is customized to accommodate even markets where internet speed is still limited,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;With online travel sales forecasted to grow to USD 762 billion by 2019 (Statistica.com), the need to capitalize on technology can not be underestimated,&rdquo; said Cyrus Onyiego, Country Manager for Jumia Travel.He emphasized on the imperative need for free flow of information, and real time update by hoteliers, adding that in order to stay on top of current and forward-focused technological needs of both customers and partners, the hotel industry must embrace the role of IT as a solution provider and not a costly liability.The new version is a so-called progressive web application, which delivers an app-like experience to the user. With a market that is highly characterized by a &quot;mobile-first&quot; adaptation, the tool is mobile-optimized, which means the app size can adapt to any screen size; be it on the mobile, smartphone, tablet or desktop.
