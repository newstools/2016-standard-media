&nbsp;The installation of West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo as the second Pokot community spokesman seems to have given him the energy to confront Jubilee Party in Kanu&rsquo;s perceived strongholds.The professor of mathematics, who was last week considered best suited to fill a 16-year vacuum left by the death of former minister Francis Lotodo, took over the important post at a traditional ceremony along the banks of River Amaya in Baringo County. The choice of Baringo was symbolic in that his party leader Gideon Moi is the Senator and the county has a large population of Pokots.Although Lonyangapuo&rsquo;s predecessor was known for his confrontational nature of resolving conflicts, the West Pokot Senator is a soft-spoken leader whose approach revolves around diplomacy and dialogue.He was elected on a Kanu ticket.The Pokots describe him as a man who has given his all for his people. For the short time he has been in politics, he has come out as defender of the community&rsquo;s interests and continues to accuse the Deputy President William Ruto, of intimidating local leaders.&ldquo;He should know that by abusing local leaders, he is also abusing the electorate, who supported Jubilee,&rdquo; Lonyangapuo said.Spoiling votes&ldquo;Ruto should know he is spoiling President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s votes in this region. We will vote for the President but not Ruto, unless he is polite.&rdquo;Since he was elected senator, Lonyangapuo has not confined himself to West Pokot, but frequently visits Tiaty and parts of Uganda to listen to the concerns of the Pokots.&ldquo;This community depends on livestock for survival and for the professor, pasture is his greatest concern. He has also promoted education and established Chesitet Primary School in Tiaty and used dialogue to resolve pasture-related conflicts,&rdquo; said Daniel Kapedo, a Pokot elder.During the extremely guarded traditional ceremony, Lonyangapuo&rsquo;s kin was picked to kill an ox with a spear and the meat roasted and served to elders and morans.There was no water or plates and the respected professor&rsquo;s roasted meat was served on green leaves placed on hot dusty soil.A grey-haired elder surged forward chewing cow fat and handed Lonyangapuo a spear similar to the ones former President Daniel Moi and Lotodo were given in 1978 and 1985, respectively.&ldquo;Only three people have gone through this ritual, it looks simple to visitors, but it means a lot to the community. What he will say after here remains unchallenged, including political decisions,&rdquo; said Ribkwo MCA Daniel Tuwit.Leaders present, including former Information minister Samuel Poghisio, lauded the community&rsquo;s choice of Lonyangapuo as their leader.Lonyangapuo wants to unseat Governor Simon Kachapin who was also elected on a Kanu ticket in 2013, but has since defected to Jubilee Party.He has teamed up with Poghisio who will vie for the Senate seat on a Kanu ticket.Poghisio said corruption been devolved and most of the funds allocated to counties have been misappropriated.
