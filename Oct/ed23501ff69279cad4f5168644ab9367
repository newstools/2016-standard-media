A major Kenyan pilots&#39; union has called for an indefinite strike beginning Oct. 18 to protest what it described as poor management at the troubled national carrier Kenya Airways, the union&#39;s general secretary said on Tuesday.&quot;We have no confidence in the airline&#39;s recovery,&quot; said a circular from Capt. Paul Gichinga, the head of the Kenya Airline Pilots Association (KALPA).&quot;KALPA&#39;s members will from 5:00 a.m. (local time) Tuesday 18th of October down their tools until a comprehensive change of guard at Kenya Airways is effected.&quot; No one from Kenya Airways was immediately available for comment.Last month Kenya Airways, which is 27 percent-owned by Air France KLM, said it was seeking foreign institutional investors to raise cash. The company has said it needs about 70 billion shillings ($692 million).Kenya Airways has been cutting and modernising its fleet, selling land and cutting jobs to recover from losses caused by a slump in tourism.
