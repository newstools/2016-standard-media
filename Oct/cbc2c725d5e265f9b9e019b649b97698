On Thursday, he declared the United States had lost and he had &quot;realigned&quot; with China.Duterte has railed against U.S. criticism of his deadly war on drugs and called President Barrack Obama a &quot;son of a bitch&quot; but has so far maintained cordial ties with U.S. ally Japan.&quot;Right now Japan seems determined to cultivate a relationship with him and will avoid the hot-button topics (eg human rights) lest Duterte also junk them as well,&quot; said one of the sources.&nbsp;Japan wants to confirm the importance of the rule of law and freedom of navigation, a Japanese government official told Reuters. It&#39;s unlikely, however, that Abe will try to intervene in Duterte&#39;s spat with Washington or discuss the Hague ruling, he added.Duterte places &quot;great value on the Philippines&rsquo; vibrant and dynamic relationship&quot; with Japan, a Philippine government spokeswoman said ahead of the visit.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Tokyo was looking at how the developments between China, the Philippines and the United States might affect Japan but would not comment.&quot;In regard to the problem in the South China Sea, we are looking reach a diplomatic solution through cooperation between with the countries involved,&quot; Suga told a regular media briefing on Friday.Japan in June committed itself to a bigger security role in Southeast Asia when then Minister of Defence Gen Nakatani said his country would help nations such as the Philippines and Vietnam build their security capabilities to deal with &quot;unilateral, dangerous and coercive actions&quot; in the South China Sea.&quot;There is more Chinese assertion in the South China Sea and Japan has more worries it will do the same the same in the East China Sea,&quot; said Alison Evans, deputy head of Asia Pacific Desk, Country Risk at IHS Markit. &quot;Japan has to be more concerned now than six months ago.&quot;On Wednesday, Abe will sign an agreement to supply two new patrol boats to the Philippines, the sources said, adding to the vessels and aircraft Japan has already provided to help keep tabs on activity in the South China Sea.Duterte and his entourage will then meet leaders from companies including Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) to seek further investments in the Philippines.Duterte concludes his trip on Thursday with a call on Japan&#39;s Emperor Akihito.&nbsp;
