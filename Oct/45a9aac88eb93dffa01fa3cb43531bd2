Governor Jack Ranguma used the absence of his major political opponents to lobby support for his 2017 re-election bid.Addressing Mashujaa Day celebrations at Jomo Kenyatta grounds, Mr Ranguma said he was confident of his track record in his first term in office.Kisumu Senator Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o, businessman Hezron Mc&#39;Obewa and Ranguma&#39;s deputy, Ruth Odinga, who have expressed interest in Ranguma&#39;s seat in next year&#39;s elections, did not attend the celebrations. However, Ker Opiyo Otondi, chairman of the Luo Council of Elders,&nbsp; defied calls from Ranguma&#39;s supporters present at the event to bless his re-election bid, and instead empahsised the need to recognise all national heroes.
