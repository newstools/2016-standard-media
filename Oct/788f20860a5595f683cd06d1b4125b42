Opposition leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka met to calm fears that their rivalry over the CORD presidential ticket was tearing the coalition apart and to also assure supporters that they were still standing together.The midday meeting at Raila&rsquo;s Capitol Hill office came hot on the heels of heated exchanges among the coalition&rsquo;s three co-principals on the formula for picking the flag-bearer. The other bone of contention was whether the ODM leader shouldn&rsquo;t step down for either Kalonzo or Ford-Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula.Supporters of Raila, Kalonzo and Wetang&rsquo;ula have all insisted their respective party leaders are best suited to fly the coalition&rsquo;s flag in coming polls, putting CORD affiliate parties at loggerheads.A source at Raila&rsquo;s office said the two leaders talked for close to three hours.Kalonzo has repeatedly said he has sacrificed for other leaders in the past, insisting it was time for Raila to reciprocate by backing his bid for State House.Wetang&rsquo;ula is also seeking the Orange Democratic Movement leader&rsquo;s exit from the ticket race, arguing he should not run this time round since he has lost three times.The Bungoma Senator wants Raila to play a king-maker role and support a ticket bringing him and Kalonzo together.Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s personal assistant Mandu Mandu told The Standard the Senator skipped the meeting because he was unwell.Mandu explained Wetang&rsquo;ula communicated his apologies to the two co-principals before the meeting took place.&ldquo;He was unwell and sent apologies to Raila and Kalonzo. He will attend subsequent meetings,&rdquo; he said.Yesterday, Raila posted a photograph of himself with Kalonzo after the meeting and said they discussed unity of the coalition.&ldquo;Consulting with my brother @skmusyoka earlier. We reaffirm the unity of our Coalition to deliver democracy and reforms to the Kenyan people,&rdquo; Raila posted on his twitter account.&ldquo;The two Principals met today and talked about Coalition unity. CORD is strong and ready for 2017,&rdquo; added ODM Communications Director Philip Etale.Details of the meeting, however, remained scanty despite our effort to dig out more.The co-principals have differed on key issues to be considered in determining the coalition&rsquo;s flag-bearer in the 2017 General Election.Further jitters in the coalition have been occasioned by the&nbsp; possibility of Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi having a deal with CORD, in a political formation that could see some of the leaders in the coalition overshadowed.Kalonzo earlier expressed discomfort, saying Mudavadi should not be favoured in the event he joins hands with the Raila-led coalition, &ldquo;since he has not sacrificed for the cause like the co-principals.&rdquo;He is apprehensive that he could be left stranded should Raila endorse someone else as the Opposition flag-bearer, with little or no time left for him to undertake his own campaign for the presidency.In a veiled attack on Mudavadi, Kalonzo claimed it would be unfair for those who have not made sacrifices, including facing the brutality of police during the anti-IEBC demonstrations, to be rewarded just because they have joined forces.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think myself that what matters is everybody to come on board even those people who were not &lsquo;eating&rsquo; teargas in the push to reform IEBC. There must be an element of sacrifice,&rdquo; argued Kalonzo in a previous interview.&ldquo;I have suffered enough and I don&rsquo;t think it is fair. We must allow justice to reign and true leadership to also emerge,&rdquo; said Kalonzo in the interview.But Mudavadi, ODM Chairman John Mbadi and other leaders accused Kalonzo of being blind to the idea of forming a super-alliance to beat Jubilee coalition in the August 8, 2017 polls.Mudavadi claimed Kalonzo&rsquo;s fears were unfounded since he was not seeking to join CORD but to work with the Opposition coalition to craft a new vehicle for next year&rsquo;s polls.&ldquo;The common purpose iws not about who will take what position but to remove the Jubilee administration from power,&rdquo; said Mudavadi.&ldquo;He is being blinded from the larger picture of bringing change to the people of Kenya by bringing together like-minded individuals,&rdquo; he added through his spokesperson Dr Kibisu Kabatesi.Raila has indicated he is ready to work with the former Sabatia MP as well as Governor Isaac Ruto of Chama Cha Mashinani.Mr Wetang&rsquo;ula too was initially against Mudavadi joining CORD side but has since welcomed the idea saying it would be &ldquo;game-shot&rdquo; in next year&rsquo;s polls.Wetang&rsquo;ula last Sunday said the coalition would beat Jubilee in a landslide if Mudavadi joins hands with CORD leaders.
