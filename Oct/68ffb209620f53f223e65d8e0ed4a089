The badly mutilated body was found dumped in a ditch.His parents are now banking on information from a&nbsp;Form Three&nbsp;student at the same school who was with Omondi on the evening he is suspected&nbsp;to have been killed. According to the police records at Yala police station under OB number 13/21/10/2016, a body of a 19 year-old boy was found lying&nbsp; in a ditch&nbsp;at Makaburini area. The police visited the scene and confirmed the incident after which the body was moved to Yala Township Hospital mortuary awaiting post-mortem.The police record further indicates that the body was smelling alcohol at the time they&nbsp;picked it from the bush where it had been lying.&quot;That is what we have so far. We are doing further investigations,&quot; said Yala OCPD Wambua Mutiso.When the Standard visited the school, Omondi&#39;s mother, Lillian Odhiambo, had just been&nbsp;meeting with the school&#39;s &nbsp;principal, the form three students from the same school and some members of the Board of Management.Omondi&#39;s mother&nbsp;said she heard from passersby, as she lives next to a road, that the&nbsp;body of a teenage boy who is suspected to be a student at Ulumbi had&nbsp;been spotted at Makaburini area.&quot;I got concerned because that was about ten o&#39;clock in the morning and I had not seen him&nbsp;yet he was also a student in the same school the passersby were talking about. But by that time the police had already taken the body to Yala Township Hospital mortuary so I went there to see if he was the one,&quot; explained an emotional Lillian.As she explained, what was awaiting her at the morgue was one of the most awful sights she had ever seen. &quot;My son died a very painful death. He had stab wounds, his face was swollen and eyes gorged out. There was a gaping wound on his forehead an indication that a blunt object was probably used to hit him,&quot; she said.&quot;He was home with his siblings the whole of Thursday which was Mashujaa Day. He is the one who prepared lunch for his three other siblings as I was away for a better part of the day. When I came back in the afternoon, he was still home,&quot; said Lillian.According to Lillian, Omondi left her house a quarter to seven and didn&#39;t tell her where he was going, not knowing that that was the last time she would see of her son.Omondi, was supposed to accompany his fellow candidate students to Sondu-Miriu hydroelectric power plant and Ahero Irrigation scheme for an academic tour the morning his body was discovered at the cemetery within Yala Township.&quot;His phone call log shows that he called a girl&nbsp;the same evening that he disappeared only to be found dead the following day,&quot; said Lillian, who had taken the numbers that called her son&#39;s line to the investigating officers to help in the investigations.Lillian also alleged that the said girl (name withheld) admitted that she was with Brian the evening of October 20, the last time he was seen.The school administration however distanced itself from the new developments, saying that since it is a matter that happened outside the school at a time dayscholars were on holiday, only the police can comment on that.
