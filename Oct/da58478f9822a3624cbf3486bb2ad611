High Court judge Wilfrida Okwany has admonished society for&nbsp;failing&nbsp;to protect girls from sex predators. The judge, while sentencing a teenage girl who killed her seven-month-old baby due to frustrations from her family, noted how the girl underwent a lot of suffering at a tender age.&quot;The accused faced constant quarrels and taunting from none other than her mother who ought to&nbsp;have&nbsp;been her only source of strength, comfort and consolation following the unfortunate circumstances that led to her pregnancy when she was least prepared to be a mother in the first place. This court notes that everything that could go wrong in a young girl&#39;s life happened to the accused herein,&quot; noted Justice Okwany.Okwany placed the 15-year-old girl under probation for three years but expressed her ire on how adult men prey on school going girls and walk away unscathed. &quot;This case is a classic demonstration of a total breakdown in societal values that previously protected young girls from sex predators and supported victims of early pregnancies by giving them hope, support and guidance when faced with such challenges,&quot; said judge Okwany.On the fateful day, February 2 this year, at about 9am, Mueni was holding the baby but her mother was displeased in the manner she was doing it. It resulted in a bitter quarrel between the two; Mueni turned to the baby with a knife to vent the anger. She stabbed the infant on the neck.&quot;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;perused and considered the probation officer&#39;s report filed in court on September 27, 2016. The report reveals that before me, is a young girl aged only 15 years but who can be said to&nbsp;have&nbsp;already &quot;seen it all&quot; at that tender age,&quot; the judge said. &quot;From the above report by the Probation Officer, it is abundantly clear to me that the accused had a very troubled childhood...&quot;The judge declined prayers to&nbsp;have&nbsp;the girl serve the sentence at home noting that she needed a place to counseled and at the same time pick up the pieces in her life. Mueni had told the judge that she wanted to return to school.&quot;After taking in to account all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case, I am inclined to agree with the Probation Officer&#39;s report that the accused herein could benefit from a probation sentence albeit away from her home environment so that she can benefit from guidance, counseling rehabilitation and close supervision,&quot; she ruled.
