Suspended Non-Governmental Organisation&rsquo;s coordination board boss Fazul Mahammed has moved to court seeking to be reinstated.Mr Mahammed is also challenging Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri&rsquo;s decision to dissolve the NGO&rsquo;s board in a suit that reveals the power struggle among civil society groups.&nbsp;&ldquo;Mr Kiunjuri&rsquo;s action to send me on compulsory leave and dissolve the NGO board was illegal, unlawful, null and void. He has no powers whatsoever to sack me or appoint an acting chief executive officer for the board,&rdquo; said Mahammed. Kiunjuri on Wednesday sent Mahammed on compulsory leave to pave way for investigations into allegations that he does not have proper academic certificates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
