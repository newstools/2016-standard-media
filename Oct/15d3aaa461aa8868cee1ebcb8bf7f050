Google has trained more than 500,000 people in Africa on digital skills under its Digital Skills For Africa Programme.The announcement, which was made alongside the launch of its new online training portal for Africa (www.digitalskills.withgoogle. com) - means that the Digital Skills training programme has now hit the 50 per cent completion mark. Google Kenya Country Manager, Charles Murito pointed out that though 500,000 people have acquired digital skills since trainings rolled-out in April, there are people across the continent who are unable to attend face-to-face training sessions and have opted to take the offline course from their phone or computer.&ldquo;The online portal will make it possible for more Kenyans and Africans to take advantage of the free digital skills training program. It contains 89 online courses on a wide range of digital subjects including online analytics, social media marketing and online advertising,&rdquo; Mr Murito stated.The Internet continues to be a key engine of growth for business in Africa and globally, with estimates putting its total contribution at $300 billion within the coming decade.Although Africa&rsquo;s online population, which currently stands at 340 million, is estimated to have grown by a rate of over 7,000 per cent since the year 2000, the continent is yet to enjoy a corresponding increase in the size of its web economy.
