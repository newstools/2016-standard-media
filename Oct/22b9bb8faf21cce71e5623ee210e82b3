&nbsp; Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has immortalised award-winning conservationist Wangari Maathai, Catholic Church cleric Maurice Cardinal Otunga and former city mayor Charles Rubia by naming city roads in their honour. In a speech read during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Pumwani yesterday, Dr Kidero said Forest Road would be renamed Prof Wangari Maathai Road. The road between City Hall Annex going past Cardinal Otunga Plaza will be named Maurice Cardinal Otunga Road in honour of the late bishop while Cross Road will be renamed Charles Rubia Road after the first African Mayor for Nairobi. &ldquo;This is for his efforts in championing multi-party democracy in Kenya,&rdquo; said Kidero in a speech read by County Secretary Robert Ayisi. The event was overshadowed by Jubilee Party politics led by area MP Maina Kamanda&rsquo;s followers.

Mr Kamanda, however, criticised the county government for not repairing and maintaining the roads, arguing that the national government had invested billions on building them. &ldquo;There is nothing the governor and his people are doing. Nairobi roads are in a dilapidated state,&rdquo; said the MP.
