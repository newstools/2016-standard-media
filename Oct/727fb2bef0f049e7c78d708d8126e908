Current and immediate former Land ministry officers have been separately charged for abuse of office. Patrick Mukuha, who was the Land registrar, was charged with making or directing a falsified green card number 7 into land parcel Kabare/Nyangati/2744, while fully aware that such an entry was fraudulent, on March 2, 1999. The charge against his successor, Julius Kirimo, stated that on May 7, 2013, within the Kerugoya Land registry, he made an arbitrary order that the green card for the same land, entry number 9, should be altered on the strength of a falsified court order. &nbsp;Chief Magistrate Francis Adai released the accused on a Sh100, 000 bond each with sureties of similar amount or Sh30,000 cash bail each. The case will be mentioned on October 24.
