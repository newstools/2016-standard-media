The couple, identified as Dennis Kirimi, 22, and Yvonne Mwendwa, 21, went missing on September 30 shortly after they gained access into Mt Kenya National Park through Sirimon Gate. Mountain climbing experts now say that the young couple&#39;s expedition was suicidal. Sources said the duo arrived at the Old Moses Camp, which is perched 3,300m above sea level, using a taxi they had hired. Old Moses Camp is situated at the end of the shrubs vegetation and near the moorlands of the mountain.

They were not accompanied by a mountain guide. But after waiting for hours, and as darkness set in, the taxi driver left. According to Simon Gitau, a senior warden at the Mt Kenya National Park and the head of the mountain rescue team, the couple was spotted by a worker at Shipton&#39;s Camp as they approached a Kenya Meteorological Department station about 5km from Old Moses Camp. &quot;But when they saw the man approach, they turned towards the camp in what is being seen as a bid to avoid meeting him, and continued trekking up the mountain,&quot; he said.
