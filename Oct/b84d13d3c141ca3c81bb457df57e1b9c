The fight for the Jubilee nomination in the Kajiado governor&#39;s race is intensifying by the day.And as the campaign gathers momentum, hopes of Team Mabadiliko&nbsp;Alliance fronting a compromise candidate are fast fading.Businessman George King&#39;ori said he was ready to face his opponents during Jubilee Party nominations. He dismissed claims that he was angling for deputy governor&#39;s position.&quot;I will not be anyone&#39;s running mate... If I defeat my opponents during the nomination stage, I urge them to support me in the main 2017 battle. I too will back them if they defeat me,&quot; he said.Speaking at DO&#39;s grounds in Kitengela during Wamasaa Sacco-organised Nganya Awards where he was the chief sponsor, Mr Kingori said he would stop at nothing to win the party ticket.The aspirant called for peaceful campaigns.&quot;Kajiado County is known for its tolerance and diversity and this is something I would like to remain and elections should not tear us apart,&quot; he said.Other aspirants in Team Mabadiliko Alliance are former Olkejuado County Council Chairman Taraiya ole Kores, Daniel Nina (Livondo), who came second to Nkedianye in 2013 and Dr Solomon Kinyanjui.The unspoken pact among the aspirants was for there to be a Maasai candidate teaming up with a Kikuyu running mate.The logic behind this was to consolidate the large Kikuyu vote in the county since the group feel its interests have not been taken care of by the Nkedianye administration.During the Kitengela event on Sunday, King&#39;ori poured cold water on the likelihood of him being a running mate of either Kores or Livondo.He said he was banking on the votes in Kajiado East and Kajiado North constituencies.King&#39;ori, who is a businessman based in Kitengela, promised to bring relief to small-scale traders whom he said were suffering the burden of heavy taxation under the Kajiado County Government.&quot;Today, for example, the average mama mboga is paying a lot more in terms of trade licences than the person operating a big hardware, yet the hardware makes more money,&quot; he said.
