About 100 shipping containers that were to be converted to mobile clinics have been lying in Mombasa since June.Government officials told The Standard the 40-foot-long&nbsp; containers at the National Youth Service (NYS) Miritini Technical College are part of a consignment believed to have been procured for Sh1 billion to be converted into clinics for remote areas and slums.An interim report of an internal audit in the Health ministry claims these kits were never delivered. Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu told journalists the containers were components of mobile clinics supplied to his ministry by Estama Investments last year.The containers are marked as having been shipped from China.Officers who guided The Standard team around the yard that is normally under heavy guard did not open the containers.No answers were given on why they have been lying been in the yard for months.Yesterday Mr Mailu said his ministry signed a Sh1 billion deal with Estama Investments to supply 100 clinics to be installed in remote and slum areas.PAYMENT MADEThe firm, he said, has already been paid Sh800 million.&ldquo;On July 17 2015 we entered contract with Estama to supply 100 mobile clinics. Estama has supplied 100 clinics which are in a yard in a depot in Mariakani. Out of the contract he (Estama Investments) has not been paid Sh200 million,&rdquo; the CS said.Mailu said that one of the containers was transported to Nairobi for demonstration to Government officials. Although the containers have been lying uncollected for months now, the CS insisted the ministry considers them delivered.&ldquo;They have been cleared and received by us and they are in a yard in Mariakani,&rdquo; he said.The CS said the containers have not been distributed because authorities are still erecting sites on which they will be installed.There was no Government official willing to explain the presence of containers.Journalists who were alerted about the containers did not encounter any problem from security agents who on normal days would not allow photographing of Government security installations.&ldquo;We saw some people bring these things here around May but we have never seen them leave,&rdquo; said a worker at the yard.The all-white containers that also bear a strip of the national flag colours were ostensibly meant to host maternity and child health services, emergency services, outpatient services, post-rape, HIV/TB care services, family planing, immunisation, growth monitoring and laboratory services.
