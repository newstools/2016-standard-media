Retail market suppliers and local manufacturers now want new legislation to compel supermarket operators settle over Sh40 billion debt resulting from late and disputed payments.The suppliers and manufacturers&rsquo; lobby wants a framework introduced in the trade policy currently being developed in the Ministry of Industrialisation and Trade that is expected to set time limits within which payments must be processed. The policy will set the stage for regulation of the retail sector.&ldquo;Payments are taking over one year instead of the 90 days agreed on with the retailers. &quot;This has caused us cash flow problems and we even have to borrow expensively from banks to finance operations,&rdquo; Association of Kenya Suppliers Chairman Kimani Rugendo told a stakeholders meeting organised by the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) and the Trade ministry.They now want a radical legislation akin to the newly enacted Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act (2015) which will force public entities that delay payments to suppliers to attract interest at market rates for every day the payment is delayed.Trade Principal Secretary Chris Kiptoo, who will present the policy to the Cabinet next week, hinted at the introduction of a retail market regulator, or roping in the competition authority to police retailers.According to the suppliers, supermarkets delay their payments on pretences that suppliers do not have efficient payment plans which make it difficult to reconcile invoices.The suppliers further reckoned that whenever payment is due, retailers have the habit of issuing post-dated cheques, forcing them to wait even longer.In fact, some of the cheques even end up bouncing, further hurting the suppliers&rsquo; relations with their respective banks.Operating in arrearsMr Rugendo said 80 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses, which badly require capital to remain afloat, are operating in arrears. &ldquo;No wonder three out of ten small firms are forced out of business by delayed payments.&rdquo;Uchumi Supermarkets, which was forced to pay suppliers promptly to stay afloat, owes suppliers Sh3.6 billion. Kenya&rsquo;s top three retailers Nakumatt, Tuskys and Naivas, owed manufacturers Sh8 billion in unpaid dues as at September last year, with some payments dating back to early 2014, according to a protest letter written two years ago.&ldquo;There are multiple reasons affecting businesses, which are different for each one of us... in our case we are going through cash flow issues that are being passed on to the suppliers. Some of the issues like Westgate are out of our control and retailers are not daemons... we need you as partners,&rdquo; Nakumatt Holdings business development leader Neel Shah explained.Last year, South African credit rating agency GCR revealed that Nakumatt&rsquo;s total debt had more than tripled in four years to Sh15 billion, from Sh4.2 billion in 2011. These debts are owed to lenders, suppliers and manufacturers.Meanwhile, the suppliers say they have to meet statutory obligations including Value Added Tax, levies which are paid every preceding month to the taxman as well as overhead costs even when though they have not received payments.&ldquo;Suppliers fear supermarkets for being blacklisted if one raises concern... I know I have been blacklisted by most of you... but please do not kill the messenger,&rdquo; Mr Rugendo of Kevian Kenya limited said.Naivas Chief Operating Office Willy Kimani said suppliers were over reliant on the product listing agreement but should engage the retailers for a joint business plan to structure payments.This, he says, will help them agree on sales, payment period, cover for theft and pilferage, warehousing and distribution. Such arrangement, he said, can be reviewed every quarter.Trufoods Director Rajan Malde, however, said the current joint business plan are made at the advantage of the retailers and are out of the reach of SMEs. He said under the trade policy, the payments should be automated.
