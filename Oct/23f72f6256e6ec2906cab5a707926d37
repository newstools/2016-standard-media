A new blueprint to guide government offices on how and when to protect the rights of Kenyans was launched yesterday. The Attorney General&#39;s office released the policy paper to entrench human rights principles in a national policy framework. Dubbed Sessional Paper No 3 of 2014 on National Policy and Action Plan on Human Rights, the paper seeks to implement Kenya&#39;s vision on human rights and set human rights goals and priorities within achievable timeframes. It also clarifies the responsibilities for the implementation of human rights, as anchored in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution. The launch sets in motion a five-year plan that elaborates broad human rights principles to guide the government and other actors in carrying out their work without violating the rights of Kenyans. Some of the key areas that have been identified include civil and political rights, access to justice and the right to political participation.
