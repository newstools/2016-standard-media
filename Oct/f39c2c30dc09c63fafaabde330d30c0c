The situation rooms, to be put in all counties, will have people ready to receive complaints about violations. Fida Women and Governance Programme Officer Lorraine Ochiel said the rooms will be linked to different organisations to provide support to women who have reported that their opponents have sent thugs to harass them. &quot;We will then be able to link you with the police station where you should report. The situation rooms will be in specific areas within the counties where victims will be able to get help without waiting for their cases to be transferred to Nairobi,&quot; she said. Media Focus on Africa programmes manager Harrison Maonga said they have bee training more than 100 women who intend to vie for various elective positions in eight counties. The targeted counties are: Kisumu, Mombasa, Kajiado, Narok, Nyandarua, West Pokot, Nandi and Trans Nzoia. They are focusing mostly on women who want to vie as Members of County Assembly and governors in next year&#39;s election.
