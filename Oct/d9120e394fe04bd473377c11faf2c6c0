Kenya does not expect to generate any profits from early oil production, with the first refined product set to be available in October 2017.Trucking of crude oil from Turkana County could start in June, the Government has said, but the commodity has to be accumulated to fill a ship &ndash; which would take at least four months. With the prevailing global prices that have remained below $50 (Sh5,000) since March last year, the initial production might not be profitable.Energy and Petroleum Ministry Permanent Secretary Andrew Kamau has said there would be no profits from initial oil production should the prevailing prices continue. &ldquo;At current oil prices, we do not expect to make much money, so there is no money to be shared,&rdquo; Mr Kamau said yesterday in a status update on oil development.He added that the production to begin next year under the Early Oil Pilot Scheme (EOPS) was intended to convince investors and financiers of the viability of the fields.&ldquo;[Kenya] needs oil prices to be about $55 (Sh5,500) per barrel to move into full-field development,&rdquo; Mr Kamau said, quoting experts, including the main investors in the Turkana basin, Tullow Oil and its partners.A barrel of crude oil is equal to 159 litres, while its yield of the refined products, including gasoline and diesel, depends on the quality. Finer qualities of crude have higher yields, and subsequently attract even higher prices.Kenya&rsquo;s crude oil could have a lower than average yield because it is waxy &ndash; a factor that would also require additional investment in the refinery to keep it heated.Kamau&rsquo;s update came on the day global prices inched past $50 per barrel on a recent precarious deal among major oil producers to cap their output to support prices.Earlier in the year, prices fell below $35 (Sh3,500) per barrel, sending shockwaves among oil producers with severe economic implications for countries like Venezuela and Angola. Increased global production compounded a dip in demand, and subsequently prices, threatening new field developments, including in Turkana.Already, 60,000 barrels of oil are sitting in tanks in the Lokichar site, which Tullow expects to stockpile utnil June 2017, when daily production is expected to rise to between 200,000 and 250,000 barrels a day.REMOTE PARTSKamau revealed for the first time Tullow&rsquo;s intention of evacuating the crude oil using 14 trucks every day, up from two that had been communicated previously. And unlike prior plans to have the commodity passed on to the railway from Eldoret, the trucks will move the consignment over the 1,000 kilometre road that passes through Kitale and Eldoret &ndash; among other towns.Contractors are on site to develop the road infrastructure in the remote parts linking the oil fields to Kitale. In Mombasa, the State projects to invest an additional Sh1.5 billion in upgrading the largely obsolete refinery in Kipevu, which will act as a storage facility for the crude oil.Kamau told reporters that Kenya does not anticipate to develop the refinery beyond just offering storage as the costs are prohibitive and that the confirmed oil reserves were too low to justify the investment.A typical refinery with the capacity to clean Kenya&rsquo;s waxy crude oil would cost anything up to Sh1 trillion to put up, against a recoverable resource of 750 million barrels. At prevailing prices, the known oil reserves are estimated to have a gross worth of Sh3.75 trillion.Tullow has reportedly spent Sh150 billion to date, and expects to spend an additional Sh1 trillion over the next 25 years in developing the oil fields &ndash; effectively dashing any prospects that developing a refinery would be a viable venture.A total of 2,000 barrels could be moved by the 14 trucks on the three-day North-South journey. But the amounts trucked down to Mombasa on any day is too small for shipping out to other countries for refining.The PS said his ministry and Tullow project to use a 250,000 barrel-capacity ship to transport the crude oil to a refinery in a yet-to-be-identified country. At the daily production and trucking capacity of 2,000 barrels, it could take up to four months to fill a single ship.
