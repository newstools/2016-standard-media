The county government has given out Sh10 million for the construction of a girls&#39; boarding school in Navakholo Constituency. The move is geared towards addressing rising cases of girls dropping out of school due to early pregnancies blamed on randy boda boda operators. Already, Sh7 million from the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) has been released to buy land for the construction of St Kizito Girls Boarding School. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, while handing over the Sh10 million cheque, said the county government was committed to ensuring girls get an equal opportunity to access quality education.
