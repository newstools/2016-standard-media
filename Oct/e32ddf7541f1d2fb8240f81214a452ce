Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has unveiled a statue of veteran freedom fighter Muindi Mbingu. The governor also committed to honor independence heroes from the region. Dr Mutua, who led hundreds of residents in the colourful event next to Kenyatta Stadium, said the recognition of the region&#39;s freedom heroes was long overdue. &quot;We are who we are today because of the actions and sacrifices of our heroes such as Muindi Mbingu. As we unveil the statute, we acknowledge his dedication and the sacrifice of other heroes including Mau Mau war veterans,&quot; said Mutua. Born in 1893, Mr Mbingu joined the colonial police force as a youth but later quit to fight against mistreatment of the local people by the colonial government. He mobilised people to wage war and resistance against the British. He is credited for exhibiting courage and resistance against the colonialists who confiscated livestock belonging to local herders in the 1940s.
