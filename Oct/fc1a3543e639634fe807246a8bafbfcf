Ladies, when you get home after a long day, nothing beats the feeling of relief that sweeps across your body when you remove the bra.The sensation is overwhelmingly rejuvenating and exhilarating; the titties &quot;who&quot; have been bundled up mercilessly together by a piece of fabric can now breath, the nipples perk heartily and the boobs bounce with glee as if in concurrence with the freedom. Breasts are the epitome of feminism, a woman is considered attractive depending on the size and shape of her chest - that is why many have gone for plastic surgery to give the &quot;twins&quot; a new lease of life especially if they have fallen like the infamous &quot;Olympus.&quot;Women have lavished so much reverence to perky breasts that for those whose twins are always in constant slumber, they are often forced to stand them to attention using the famous &quot;push up&quot; bras, which literally bundle them together and pushes them up to create the much envied &quot;cleavage.&quot;October 13 is the world &quot;No Bra Day&quot;; might a tad bit come about as a little cheeky and uncomfortable for the conservative lot but it bears more significance than just letting the titties bounce.October is cancer awareness month and having a &quot;no bra day&quot; in the same month is relevant immensely to the awareness campaigns.In Kenya and with the era of social media, though a very crucial day in the awareness campaign, the day was not short of humorous memes that depicted the excitement, especially from the other sex at the prospect of women not wearing bra.In reality, as we commemorated the day, 90 per cent of the women who were in support of the &quot;no bra day&quot; were wearing bras on the very day.However, save for the memes and humorous posts on our social media platforms, many comprehended the message that was deeper than just not wearing a bra and understood that it meant embracing preventive measures against breast cancer.It was encouraging to see men who supported the hash tag on Twitter and who supported women and if anything, men are also prone to breast cancer.So what about the bra and the hullabaloo that comes with a day of not wearing the same?Research has shown, and many physicians are in accord, that wearing a tight bra can cut off lymph drainage which consequently can contribute to breast cancer.According to a publication by Dr Michael Schater on Prevention and Complementary Treatment of Breast Cancer, &quot;the nature of bra, the tightness and length of time worn will all influence the degree of blockage of lymphatic drainage&quot;.Thus, wearing a bra might contribute to the development of breast cancer when the drainage is cut and toxic chemicals are trapped in the breast.This does not in any way imply that wearing a bra is wrong; the clothing is undoubtedly a huge support device and gives comfort especially when one wears the correct size.Many women simply wear the bra for the sake of it, most of them do not know their bra sizes and end up wearing bras that do not fit.It is thus in your &quot;breast-interest&quot; that you know your breast size and shop for a comfortable bra.The common underwire bras that have metals underneath are said to be dangerous and slow killers, according to research.Medical anthropologists have also found out that women who wear bras 24 hours a day have a 3 out of 4 chance of developing breast cancer, those who wear bras for only 12 hours and do not go to bed in bras had a 1 out of 7 risk while those who rarely wear a bra had a 1 out of 168 chance.So there you have it, ladies: wear them comfortable, avoid strangling the twins and if you can wear alternatives like female vests, boob tops or if you can stay clear off the brassiere, the better.Let those titties breath as much as they can.
