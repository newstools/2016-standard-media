The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)&#39;s victory in the three out of four ward by-elections across the country has assured the party that it still has a grip of its strongholds.ODM won in Nyacheki ward in Kisii, Mosiro and Kalokol in Kajiado and Turkana, respectively, while Jubilee took Sala ward in Tana River County. The Orange party&#39;s win is seen as a strong message that the Opposition party is still strong across the country.But Kajiado North MP Moses ole Sakuda said looking at it keenly, Jubilee Party and President Uhuru Kenyatta had gained in all the seats that were initially ODM&#39;s.&quot;We have significantly eaten into ODM&#39;s support and they continue to lose. If they do not lock their votes well, they will as well forget the Maasai and Turkana votes. The signs are there for them to see,&quot; said Sakuda.He said ODM continued to lose favour across the country and even in their victories, numbers are reduced.&quot;In 2013, ODM candidate in Mosiro beat the Jubilee one by 80 votes, in the by-election the margin was 33. They must be asking themselves where the 50 votes could have gone. By next year, we will have taken over from them,&quot; said Sakuda.However, Kajiado Senator Peter Mositet, although agreeing that the ruling party was gaining ground, noted that a lot needed to be done to stop the Opposition from the continued grip.&quot;Our think tanks need to go back to the table and strategise. We cannot to be complacent,&quot; said Mositet.In Kisii, the victory of ODM&#39;s Naftal Onkoba with a clear margin has sent shivers down the spines of politicians who recently decamped to Jubilee Party.ODM treasurer Timothy Bosire said the win was not by luck, but hard work by residents, particularly the youth who believe that the country&#39;s leadership needs change.He said the region will not be swayed, despite the several development promises by the government in the past three years.&quot;Deputy President William Ruto has made several trips to Gusii region, particularly Kisii County, but he should be reminded that Kenyans will not stoop too low and all they want is change,&quot; said Bosire.In Turkana, the contest in Kalokol ward by-election was a renewal or rivalry between Governor Josephat Nanok and Senator John Munyes and by extension supremacy battle by ODM and Jubilee Party.Both Nanok and Munyes are running for the governor&#39;s position on ODM and JP tickets, respectively.&quot;The victory of ODM candidate in Kalokol is a clear message that Jubilee is in trouble,&quot; said Nanok.
