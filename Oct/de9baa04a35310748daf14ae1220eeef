ODM has given President Uhuru Kenyatta 48 hours to explain why he chose to ignore historical contribution made by the doyen of Opposition politics, the late Jaramogi Oginga Odinga.Yesterday, the Opposition asked the President to treat all Kenyans fairly and stop regarding those from communities perceived to be Opposition stronghold with &quot;disdain&quot;. ODM&#39;s Director of Elections Opiyo Wandayi and Nyando MP Fred Outa claimed Jaramogi&#39;s exclusion from the list of heroes read by President Kenyatta during Mashujaa Day was an open discrimination against the Luo community.&quot;The President&#39;s deliberate attempt to shun the role played by Jaramogi, who is arguably one of the founding fathers of this country, shows disregard to the Luos,&quot; Wandayi said.Also missing from the list were former Cabinet Minister Tom Mboya and CORD principal Raila Odinga. Some of those honoured by the President on Thursday are Jomo Kenyatta, Achieng Oneko, Kenneth Matiba, Charles Rubia, Masinde Muliro, dedan Kimathi and Paul Ngei.Others are the late Mutula Kilonzo, Martha Karua and James Orengo.The MPs said the role played by Jaromogi in the liberation struggle cannot be forgotten.&quot;Jaramogi played a big role in pushing for the release of Mzee Jomo Kenyatta from detention. Yet the President wants us to forget this. This is unacceptable,&quot; said Wandayi.&quot;It defies political sense to claim on one hand that you want Kenyans to be united while acting in a manner inconsistent with the principle laws of cohesiveness. Given that the president is the symbol of national unity, his actions were not good in the spirit of nationhood,&quot; Outa said.In Nairobi, ODM Communications Director Philip Etale questioned the President&#39;s decision to overlook key heroes in the struggle for independence.&quot;Recognising someone for their achievement and or contribution to the nation even if you hate them doesn&#39;t make you a lesser human. In fact, it is Godly,&quot; read part of the statement.
