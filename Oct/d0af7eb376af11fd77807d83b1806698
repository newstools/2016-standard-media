Chase Bank, which was placed under receivership in April, is betting on new business from the youth and start-ups to fully recover.The bank&rsquo;s youth banking manager, Lonina Leteipan, said the lender expects to restore its vibrancy by supporting enterprise ideas.&ldquo;Youth banking has always been a core pillar for Chase Bank, and we are always keen to take part in initiatives that support the growth of young entrepreneurs,&rdquo; said Mr Leteipan, adding that the bank was exploring ways of engaging with young businesses as part of its turnaround strategy. &ldquo;For 20 years now, Chase Bank has been at the epicentre of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, giving support to companies that have grown to become market leaders,&rdquo; he added, speaking during the Young Entrepreneurs Dinner (YED) in Nairobi, which was co-sponsored by Chase Bank. YED is aimed at bringing together business leaders and young entrepreneurs to create opportunities for mentorship and future partnerships.Leteipan said the bank&rsquo;s strength rests on four pillars: the staff, whose average age is 26, which helps them connect with youthful customers and young businesses; innovation; partnerships; and the relatively young brand Chase Bank is in the industry.Businessman Chris Kirubi also addressed the dinner, saying: &ldquo;The Youth Entrepreneurship Dinner is an opportunity for our youth to progress. They deserve mentorship from more experienced individuals, which will influence and offer them a chance to identify and develop skills that will enable them to succeed as entrepreneurs.&rdquo;
