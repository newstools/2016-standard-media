Majority of Kenyans do not see elections as vehicles to elect new leaders with only 26 per cent holding the view that votes are fairly counted, a new research has shown.Findings of the survey show that majority of citizens express serious concerns about the fairness of vote counts, corruption during elections, and the safety of voters during campaigns and at the polls. The research by Afrobarometer, a pan-African, non-partisan research network that conducts public attitude surveys on democracy and governance in Africa, shows that elections are not working well as mechanisms to ensure that people&#39;s views are represented and that voters can hold non -performing leaders accountable.Low levels of public confidence in the vote count put a country at risk of post-election protest and violence in response to perceived voter fraud and manipulation, Afrobarometer cautions.&quot;Several countries with a history of election-related violence express low levels of confidence in the vote count, including Kenya (26 per cent) Zimbabwe (22 per cent) and Nigeria (6 per cent),&quot; says the report that collected views in 36 African states including Kenya.However, the research says that rural residents have higher regard of electoral process in Kenya because of limited amount and quality of information they receive.Large majorities have faith in the vote count in Niger (where 69 per cent),Mauritius (67 per cent), and Senegal (63%), but in 30 out of 36 surveyed countries, fewer than half of all citizens fully trust the vote count.The startling statistics extend to the Independent Electoral Commission of Kenya (IEBC) where only a quarter of the population has full trust in the institution. While 23 per cent say they just have a little trust in the body, 22 per cent say they do not trust it at all. Six per cent are indifferent.Poor electoral management, the research warns, can enable election fraud leading to political alienation, public mistrust, protest, and violence even if such mismanagement does not swing an election.Kenya&#39;s trust in electoral body has dropped by seven percentage points in a period between 2011 and 2014.&quot;Kenya implemented biometric voter registration and identification before its 2013 general elections, but procurement, management, and technical problems led manyKenyans to question the integrity or competence of the electoral commission,&quot; says the report.The report comes at a time IEBC is looking for a consultant to verify the accuracy of its voter register and recommend ways of enhancing the accuracy.In the same research, many Kenyans (56 per cent) say that voters are often bribed while 32 per cent say it happens sometimes. Just nine per cent of Kenyans told Afrobarometer that voter bribery does not punctuate Kenyan elections.At this level, the country ranks nine out of the 36 surveyed countries in voter bribery. Nigeria and Tunisia are also casualties with 57 per cent and 58 per cent respectively saying bribery often happens.More worrying is that Kenya is among the top five countries among the 36 surveyed where fear engulfs many people during election period.Three quarters of Kenyans told Afrobarometer that voters are often threatened and intimidated during polls. Other countries which experience higher cases are Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Egypt and Gabon.&quot;This may call into question the legitimacy of the election process, since violence and intimidation can be used as manipulative tools to suppress campaign activities, voter turnout, and civil-society activities designed to ensure a free and fair election,&quot; warns Afrobarometer.The space of opposition in Kenya has also been questioned with 47 per cent of respondents saying opposition candidates are subjected to intimidation to prevent them from vying in elections.Interference with the opposition, the research network warns, has the ability to slow even the strongest opposition parties from gaining momentum and expanding their reach.According to the body, increasing public trust in electoral commissions will depend on better management of components of the election process, from voter rolls to vote counts.&quot;Election assistance should be sustained, rather than focused only on early pre-election and Election Day activities, and should be accompanied by public sensitization efforts,&quot; it recommends.This is the fifth time Afrobarometer is sampling views from Kenya. Previous researches were done in 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2011.
