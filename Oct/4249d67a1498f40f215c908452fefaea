This was partly driven by staff costs that shot up by 18.6 per cent to Sh1.4 billion.Despite emerging the 12th most profitable bank in full year to December last year, the bank&rsquo;s return on assets was 3.55 per cent, being beaten by less profitable lenders such as Prime Bank, Habib Bank, Bank of Baroda and Gulf African Bank.The news comes less than a year after nine managers were sacked last December in connection with the Sh791 million National Youth Service scandal.
