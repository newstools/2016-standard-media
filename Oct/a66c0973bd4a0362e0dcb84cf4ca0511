As the clock tick to the 2017 elections, political realignments are taking shape in Nakuru County.Of the 11 constituencies in the county, only Nakuru Town West is represented by an opposition legislator. But the defection of incumbent Samuel Arama to the Jubilee Party (JP) has complicated matters in the highly cosmopolitan constituency as aspirants eye the seat.About 20 hopefuls from the two political divides have begun campaigns to dislodge Arama. Prior to the 2013 polls, Mr Arama was a member of The National Alliance (TNA) but jumped ship to join ODM. He won the seat with 19,959 votes against Charles Masiba of TNA, who garnered 17,837.The constituency had 71,593 registered voters in the last elections. Political analysts say with the merger of 11 Jubilee affiliate parties, the Orange party has to work hard to retain the seat.&ldquo;It will be a bigger mountain to climb for ODM taking into consideration that the area is a Jubilee zone. If JP fields a single candidate, it will likely win the seat in a landslide,&rdquo; says Andrew Nyabuto, a local political commentator.Of the 20 candidates who have expressed interest in the seat so far, eight of them will fight it out for the JP ticket. They are John Kitilit, Victor Ngatia, Mwangi Kariko, Charles Maisiba, William Towet, Mohamed Suraw, Francisca Kamuren and Arama have hit the ground running.The Opposition has drawn the interest of Eric Ogada, Sospeter Nyakundi, Hezron Okiki, Isoe Ochoki, Peter Ndubi, Likwilo Ndeta, Jimmy Ojwang and James Michoma.According to local Jubilee stalwarts, the party is keen to ensure a fair nomination process in a bid to avoid a fall-out that might cost it the seat. &ldquo;One of our strategies to capture the Nakuru Town West parliamentary seat is to ensure the nomination process is fair so that all losers support the winner,&rdquo; says James Karimi, a businessman who has been vocal calling for unity among aspirants.Karimi says Jubilee lost to the Nakuru Town West seat to ODM in 2013 because it allowed TNA and URP to field separate candidates despite being in one coalition.Counter-offensiveBut local opposition leaders say they will also field one candidate to take on Jubilee in next year&rsquo;s polls. &ldquo;We are in talks with like minded leaders to ensure the Nakuru Town West seat remains with the opposition,&rdquo; says Hilton Abiola, an ODM youth leader.Nakuru County ODM Chairman Peter ole Osono says they are aware of the tactics employed by Jubilee and will counter them effectively.&ldquo;Arama may have left ODM but he left alone. His defection will not affect our support in the constituency,&rdquo; he says.CORD is also eyeing the Kivumbini and Kaputembwo wards that are currently held by ODM.Arama has consistently defended his decision to join Jubilee, saying his constituents have benefited greatly under the ruling coalition.&ldquo;I made the decision because I will serve the people of Nakuru Town West far much better when in government than in the opposition. I realised that nothing much can be achieved while in Opposition,&rdquo; he told The Standard on Sunday.&nbsp;The constituency is made up of six electoral wards that are predominantly occupied by low-income earners working in the informal sector.Most residents are from Western Kenyan and Nyanza regions who came to Nakuru in search of employment.Analysts say Arama&rsquo;s election in 2013 gave hope to this group that had for long been left out of the region&rsquo;s leadership.
