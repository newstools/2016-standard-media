A joint U.S., Russian and Japanese crew left the International Space Station on Saturday aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule and landed back on Earth, leaving behind three crew mates who arrived at the orbiting outpost just last week.Station commander&nbsp;Anatoly Ivanishin, with the Russian space agency, NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and Japan&rsquo;s Takuya Onishi climbed inside the capsule and left the station at 8:35 p.m. EDT, a NASA TV broadcast showed.The trio made a parachute landing in Kazakhstan at 11:58 p.m. EDT, wrapping up a four-month mission that included the first use of a DNA sequencer in space and installation of a parking spot for upcoming commercial space taxis. &quot;I&#39;m kind of reluctant to close the hatch,&quot; Ivanishin said during a change-of-command ceremony on Friday.&quot;The time is very special here ... I didn&#39;t have time to know what&rsquo;s going on our planet, and maybe it&rsquo;s for the better. On the space station, you live in a very friendly, very good environment.&quot;Ivanishin turned over command of the space station, a $100 billion orbiting research lab, to newly arrived U.S. astronaut Shane Kimbrough.Kimbrough and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko reached the outpost on Oct. 21.&quot;We&rsquo;re sorry we&rsquo;re only here a week with you,&quot; Kimbrough told the departing crew after taking command on Friday. &quot;You guys have trained us well though.&quot;Kimbrough, Ryzhikov and Borisenko will be on their own until next month, when another three crew members are due to reach the station, a project of 15 nations that orbits about 250 miles (418 km) above Earth.
