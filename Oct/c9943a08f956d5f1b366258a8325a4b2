The courts have for a second time quashed the appointment of the chairman of the Anti-Counterfeit Agency (ACA). Justice George Odunga ruled that Polycarp Igathe was improperly appointed.Mr Igathe, who was re-appointed last year December after the same court revoked his first appointment, will not head the agency&rsquo;s board after the judge said his appointment was mired in irregularities.In addition, the judge said the Ministry of Industrialisation did not consider that Igathe&rsquo;s position at the Anti-counterfeit Agency would amount to conflict of interest. Justice Odunga quashed the gazette notice dated December 24, 2015, where Igathe had been given the green light to head the agency charged with curbing trade in counterfeit products.Rectify results&ldquo;In my view, the decision purporting to appoint the Interested Party [Igathe] as the chairperson of the Agency cannot therefore be allowed to stand on two grounds,&rdquo; Odunga ruled.&ldquo;First, the process of appointment of the said Interested Party was tainted with procedural impropriety. Secondly, the appointing authority failed to take into consideration relevant materials to wit the Interested Party&rsquo;s suitability for the said position, taking into account his perceived conflict of interest.&rdquo;Further, the judge said the appointing authority did not rectify the mistakes that had led to Igathe&rsquo;s appointment being revoked the first time before it reappointed him.Odunga also pointed out that the second appointment was backdated to when the court made its first decision, adding that this was rather mischievous and malicious.&ldquo;In the earlier decision, this Court clearly made findings as to why the decision could not stand. It is alleged that the third respondent [Industrialisation ministry] in his decision under challenge in these proceedings did not correct the said mistakes but simply repeated the same.&ldquo;In fact, it is alleged that the impugned decision purported to backdate the appointment to the time of the decision, which was nullified. In my view, if that position is correct, not only would res judicata not apply but the decision of the third respondent would have been mischievously and maliciously arrived at.&ldquo;Such action would obviously be frowned at as it would amount to turning judicial proceedings into a circus and amount to abuse of judicial process as well as abuse of power, as the Respondent would then be seeking to achieve a collateral purpose.&rdquo;Odunga added that the ministry headed by Adan Mohamed ought to have scrutinised Igathe&rsquo;s suitability for the seat.&ldquo;Whereas this Court cannot in these proceedings conclude whether or not the Interested Party was a proper person to chair the Board of Directors of the Agency, the appointing authority, in light of the earlier decision of this Court, ought to have resolved the issues which led to the earlier decision before purporting to appoint the Interested Party to the same position,&rdquo; the judge ruled.
