At least 22 Form Four candidates will not sit this year&#39;s national examinations because they are not registered.The candidates were not registered to sit the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams because their school is not registered with the Ministry of Education.

Standard one, Two, Three and Four students share one classroom. Standard Five, Six and Seven students are also combined in one classroom.In one building marked as laboratory, only an old newspaper and a broken chair could be seen.Ministry of Education officials and security officers yesterday visited the institution to investigate the matter.Initially operatingArea assistant chief Mwaura Wagacha told&nbsp;The Standard&nbsp;the school was initially operating as a community-based organization (CBO) offering education to underprivileged children from the neighbourhood.&quot;Parents who take their children to the school are those who cannot afford fees. They brought them here after they were promised assistance. There is no official list of teachers here since most of them are volunteers and university students,&quot; said Wagacha.Kiambaa sub-county director of education Francis Kibiko said the school, which has been in operation since 2013, is not registered.Mr Kibiko, while on a tour of the school yesterday, said: &quot;We were not aware the school was operating until today when we received complaints from some parents that it collected examination fees but never registered the candidates.&quot;He noted they intend to close the school after a meeting with parents set for today.He said the students will be relocated to registered schools and the director of the school arrested.Area OCPD Wilberforce Sicharani said: &quot;We have taken the proprietor to record a statement to ascertain the truth of the allegations that Form Four students paid examination fee but they were not registered.&quot;&quot;We have also learned through the education office that the school is operating without a licence. We are investigating the matter as well,&quot; said Sicharani. He said Masinde will charged in court.
