Police are ready to collaborate with the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) to enforce laws governing illegal pornographic literature in public service vehicles.Speaking during a courtesy call on him by KFCB officials, the Coast Region Enforcement Officer Emmanuel Okanda said his office welcomes joint training to familiarise the police with laws that govern such&nbsp;so as to empower law enforcers to have those breaking the law could be held accountable.He also welcomed proposals to share information on both drug peddlers as well and those using underage girls especially at the coast for pornographic films. The meeting heard that things are getting worse with the Coast increasingly becoming the location for shooting bestiality films ready for the cyberspace porn market. &ldquo;Our first call of duty is to enforce all the laws and since CAP 222 is one of our laws we are ready to work with you to see to it that the law is followed to the letter,&rdquo; he said while addressing KFCB officials Dr Ezekiel Mutua,&nbsp;Bishop Jackson Kosgey and Katua Nzile who had paid him a courtesy call at his office in Kizingo, Mombasa.Dr Mutua briefed the officer on the board&lsquo;s strategy and activities geared toward protecting children from negative effects of media as well as from&nbsp;sexual crimes using film and other media platforms.Board Chairman Bishop Kosgey shared that as a way of decentralising its activities they have divided the country into nine regions and has assigned at least a board director to oversee its operations in those regions.&ldquo;We have seen the need to help the people have an easier access to our operations and that&#39;s why for this region Katua Nzile has been picked to help with matters policy and other directions,&quot; said Bishop Kosgey who is part of the team on a three day working&nbsp; tour of the Coast.
