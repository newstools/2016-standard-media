National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki have defended President Uhuru Kenyatta on grafts claims facing his administration in the wake of calls by the opposition leaders calling for his resignation.The leaders who were speaking during a fundraiser at Gitombani church in Maara constituency, acussed opposition leader Raila Odinga of playing double standards on serious issues pertaining corruption. The Speaker said the report that has raised eyebrows of possibility of misappropriation some sh 5.3 billion in the health ministry was not confirmed by the auditor general.He said the drafts of the report, done by a internal auditor were leaked by the staff to the opposition leaders, who rushed to the public to thrash the government without interrogations being conducted.Additionally, he said a similar report that was not verified by the auditor general was leaked during the grand coalition government which Raila Odinga was the Prime Minister.The said interim report placed the then Minister for water Charity Ngilu in the middle of a scandal over misappropriation of funds meant for construction of a dam in Machakos.Muturi said Raila Odinga passionately defended Ngilu on grounds that the leaked report was not confirmed by the auditor general.&quot;If you believed then that it was an interim report that cannot be used as the basis for even calling on the resignation of the minister and indeed not even remotely connected as a principal that time to call for your resignation, how comes now you are using a similar report to call for resignation of the President? Isn&#39;t that double standards?&quot; he said.He said that it is not a crime for anyone to trade with the government, rubbishing Raila&#39;s confrontation on Kenyatta family after a company was linked in the scandal.&quot;It is good to criticize but let us have balanced and fair criticism, let not just do it for the sake of elections,&quot; he added.Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki said opposition have a well-orchestrated scheme to link the entire jubilee government in graft so as to discredit it ahead of next year&rsquo;s general elections.&quot;The draft was at some point cooked by the opposition mafias who want to discredit Uhurus administration, they would have waited until the report is taken to the auditor general and have interogations done, why they used a report given through a back door,&quot; Kareke said.&nbsp;
