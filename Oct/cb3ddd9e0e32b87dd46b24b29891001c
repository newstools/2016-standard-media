Two people were Sunday night seriously wounded in a fire incident caused by a gas explosion in Ndenderu area, Kiambu County. The two were part of a group working at an illegal gas filling point when one of the cylinders leaked and caused a fire and loud explosion. Police and locals said the fire spread fast, burning the two as their colleagues escaped. An engine from the county Goverment arrived at the scene and contained it. Police said the workers at the station were attempting to fill two gas cylinders when fire broke out. They were treated at Ndenderu Health Centre and later referred to Kiambu Hospital for further treatment. The gas station has been operating secretly. This comes a day after revelations that there are many filling stations operating in the area illegally. Energy Regulation Commission (ERC) officials are planning a raid in the area.
