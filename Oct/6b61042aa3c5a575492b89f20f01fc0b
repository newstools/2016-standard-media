The curtain came down on the first edition of the Siaya County talent search festival in Bondo last weekend, courtesy of National Government Affirmative Action Fund.Sihayi modern dancers from Ugunja sub-county were among top performers at the gala, with a captivating dance dubbed Holy Ghost. The modern dance focused on schools and showed how students become inducted into the vice and its tragic consequences.Drug abuse, early marriage and peer pressure are among the leading vices in society, and the dances were very relevant to youths as it urged them to avoid these at all costs. In the traditional dances, 79-year-old Vitalis Ong&rsquo;enga needed just three minutes to win in the own composition category with his historical message on Kenya&rsquo;s struggle for independence.Clad in a kitengee top and looking resplendent in a traditional head dress, the elderly man entertained the audience with his dances that sent the hall roaring in applause.Vitalis&rsquo; performance was very effective in sending a lasting message within as short a time as possible. It reignited memories of the Mau Mau struggle and inception of devolution and was well received by the jam-packed hall.More than 500 participants attended the festival held at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology (Jooust) hall in Bondo. A one day gala, graced by County MP Dr Christine Ombaka and Jooust Vice Chancellor Prof Stephen Agong&rsquo;, was held in honour of the best performances.Aloyce Odhiambo and David Onyango scooped awards in the stand up comedy while Ugunja Super Stars - which comprises women playing Ohangla, gave a truly authentic traditional entertainment time and space.Henry Kisinger and Maria Acheche emerged position one and two respectively in the solo verse category where nine-year-old Hilda Joyce also left her mark.Dr Ombaka was full of praise for the event which she said provides an opportunity to talk about issues affecting the community through dance, poetry and comedy.&ldquo;So many things have changed over the years and the ceremony is going to address emerging issues such as unemployment, drug abuse, radicalisation, health and issues of economic empowerment,&rdquo; Ombaka says. Prof Agong&rsquo; said the festival provides an opportunity for interaction and noted there are many issues that can be addressed through such events.79-year-old Vitalis Ong&rsquo;enga shows his skill.
