Kenya Airways (KQ) lost at least Sh3.2 billion through purchase of expensive jet fuel between 2013 and 2015, an audit has found.Initial findings of the forensic audit by Deloitte Consulting Ltd showed the airline chose to buy her fuel through a &ldquo;flawed jet fuel procurement process&rdquo;. This denied the national carrier the much-needed savings that were being enjoyed by other airlines who were buying their fuel through the African Airlines Association (Afraa).&ldquo;It is the responsibility of the jet fuel procurement manager, as well as the head of supply chain, to ensure that KQ always obtains the best possible prices for any products purchased. In addition, these same individuals are part of the Afraa tender committee, responsible for procuring on behalf of the association,&rdquo; says Deloitte.Price bargainsAfraa was formed in 2008, but only became operational in 2012 when it first began to procure jet fuel on behalf of its members.The association provides airlines with a better bargaining position with the fuel suppliers by combining all the volumes of the member airlines and procuring the fuel as a single unit.The result of this arrangement was price bargains for each of the member airlines owing to the fact that the fuel prices are highly dependent on the volumes purchased.The report shows KQ could have saved Sh3.2 billion at the current exchange rates if it had obtained similar prices as Afraa did.&ldquo;The fact that KQ was not able to obtain better prices or even similar prices to the prices obtained by Afraa is evidence of a flawed procurement process. This is compounded by the fact that KQ consumes significantly higher volumes of fuel than Afraa in Kenya,&rdquo; the report adds.Deloitte did at least 10 reports on different sections of the airline from procurement, ticketing, special purpose vehicles, and jet fuel procurement.The purchases were happening at a time when the airline was sinking deeper and deeper in losses.The airline made two consecutive losses of Sh26 billion in the last two years of the audit, losing a cumulative Sh52 billion.&nbsp;The airline made its purchases using the Open Tender Pricing System (OTS) while Afraa uses the Mean of Platts Arab Gulf (Mopag) pricing model.Asked why it encouraged her suppliers to bid based on OTS, KQ said it was in the suppliers&rsquo; request that the bids be carried out in that pricing model and not any other price structure.&ldquo;We established that in the OTS pricing model, the risk of increases in freight and premium costs rests entirely on KQ, as the company has to bear the cost of increases in freight and premium and all the other costs that are incurred in the importation of the fuel,&rdquo; the report notes.Audit&#39;s concernsThe airline ignored its internal audit function that had raised concerns over the difference in pricing basis used by Afraa and KQ.Afraa secretary told the auditors that the association prefers to obtain quotations based on Mopag price model.&ldquo;Mopag is superior as most of the variable costs are fixed, and thus the risk associated with the variables are also fixed as opposed to OTS, where the client is not in control of the price movements and bears all the associated risks,&rdquo; the report notes.The secretary further explained that the invitations were open to all suppliers, as long as they were compliant with the IATA regulations and standards, and have the capacity and, most importantly, can meet all the requirements stipulated in the terms of reference.Ironically, the purchase model was validated by advisory firm McKinsey, which has been earning billions of shillings for providing consultancy services to the airline.The airline&rsquo;s officials also persisted that OTS was cheaper than Afraa and elaborated.&ldquo;Jet fuel supply chain data obtained for the last 30 months (Jan 2014 to June 2016) from Vivo, Gulf and Bakri and validated by McKinsey confirmed that KQ has saved over USD2 million on fuel procurement at JKIA by using OTS methodology compared to Mopag,&rdquo; the employees in charge told auditors.McKinsey earned at least Sh2.6 billion in consultancy fees in the last six months. But as it later turned out, the lower prices as validated by the firm were due to decreasing freight cost.
