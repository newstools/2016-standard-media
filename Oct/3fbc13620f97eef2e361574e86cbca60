ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has asked CORD to iron out in-house squabbles if it wishes to form an alliance with him.Mr Mudavadi noted the Opposition was seemingly divided, and Jubilee may take advantage of the disunity to sow seeds of discord and beat them again next year.CORD principals Raila Odinga, Moses Wetang&#39;ula, and Kalonzo Musyoka have all expressed interest to be flag bearers of the coalition, something that seems to be rocking the Opposition. &quot;A united Opposition will be essential in ensuring a credible election devoid of disputes is conducted,&quot; Mudavadi said.He added: &quot;We want an alliance that is not ethnic-based. We want the country to get the best leadership and be redeemed from its suffocating economy.&quot;The former Sabatia MP said ANC was consolidating its vote-rich regions, before moving forward and joining other like-minded individuals to form a National Supper Alliance (Nasa).United for changeHe reiterated that the super-alliance was not only about joining CORD but will include various groups like the Central Organisation for Trade Unions (Cotu), religions, business community and other Kenyans who are willing to be part of change.&quot;We are vouching for something bigger and dynamic than just joining CORD and fighting together. I am not joining CORD. I am just advocating for creation of a supper alliance,&quot; Mudavadi said.He said ANC was open and willing to engage other parties in creating the super alliance and called on other Kenyans to think critically about the same.&quot;We must remember that there are many other important sectors of the economy that do not necessarily involve political parties and which are in agreement that the country is not in the right hands. Those are the ones we are targeting,&quot; he said.Mudavadi spoke when he met over 1,200 opinion leaders drawn from Luanda and Emuhaya constituencies at the Church of God in East Africa headquarters at Kima in Vihiga County, yesterday.He was with MPs Yusuf Chanzu (Vihiga) and Alfred Agoi (Sabatia) and ANC secretary general Geoffrey Osotsi, among others.
