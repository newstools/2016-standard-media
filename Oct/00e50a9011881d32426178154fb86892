Teachers&rsquo; salary raise talks enter a defining moment this week when the Government is expected to table a counter offer to unions.The Treasury has reportedly given the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) &ldquo;something to work with&rdquo;, interpreted as a counter offer to the unions&rsquo; 300 per cent pay increment proposal. Today, TSC officials &ndash; who have retreated to Naivasha &ndash; will hold talks with officials of Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut), who want the discussions concluded.Teachers&#39; unions return to the negotiation table hoping for an offer to counter their 300 per cent salary demand.Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) officials are expected this morning to meet their Teachers Service Commission (TSC) counterparts for what could be the make-or-break week on salary talks.TSC officials had retreated to Naivasha after, reportedly, being given by Treasury &quot;something to work with&quot;.The Knut negotiators are expected to join the TSC team in Naivasha today with expectation that a counter offer will be given.Representatives of secondary school teachers are also expected to meet the employer this week after both unions toned down their push so as to give TSC time to consult.Knut&#39;s top decision-making organ, the National Executive Council (NEC), met last week and insisted on the 300 per cent demand even as speculation was rife that teachers may get less than 10 per cent.Speaking last week after the NEC meeting, Secretary General Wilson Sossion said he had been instructed to remain &#39;firm and focused&#39; during the talks, insisting that teachers would not sign a weak deal.&quot;We will not put our pens to a weak deal. We have told the employer as much,&quot; said Mr Sossion.The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) said they were hopeful for a better deal after TSC asked for additional time to consult.&quot;These are talks of give and take. We hope to see what they have and we shall take it up from there,&quot; said Kuppet Secretary General Akelo Misori.He said no offer had been given during last week&#39;s meeting, adding that &#39;goodwill is evident&#39;.&quot;We have met the TSC team and they seem a focused entity with teachers&#39; plight at heart. Let&#39;s wait and see what they give us this week,&quot; said Misori.Details of talks have remained scanty from the TSC, with senior officials quiet on the matter.After last week&#39;s meeting, Knut officials also refused to talk on the anticipated counter-offer by TSC even as reports indicated the employer had put an offer on the table.
