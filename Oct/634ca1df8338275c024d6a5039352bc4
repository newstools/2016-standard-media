&nbsp; Mogadishu: Gunmen from Somalia&#39;s al Shabaab militant group shot dead a senior intelligence officer as he walked to a mosque in Mogadishu late on Monday, police and the group said. Colonel Abdiasis Araye was killed in the capital&#39;s Waberi district, police officer Ismail Hussein told Reuters. &quot;We reached the scene but the militants had already escaped,&quot; Hussein added. Al Shabaab launches regular attacks in Mogadishu in its bid to topple Somalia&#39;s Western-backed government and impose its version of Islam. It often targets troops and police officers from a 22,000-strong African Union force known as AMISOM that supports Somalia&#39;s army. Al Shabaab&#39;s spokesman for military operations, Abdiasis Abu Musab, said the group killed Colonel Araye.
