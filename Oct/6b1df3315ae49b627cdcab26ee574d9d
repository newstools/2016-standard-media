CORD leader Raila Odinga has faulted the Jubilee Government for failing to secure Kenyans who are suffering under the hands of ruthless cattle rustlers in Kerio Valley.Raila said insecurity in Kerio Valley is threatening the gains registered in the region in the past decade, adding that schools have been closed, children are being orphaned, the elderly are fleeing their homes and farms lie abandoned.He said: &quot;I wish to draw the attention of President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Jubilee administration, to the carnage and lawlessness that has gone on in the Kerio Valley since May 2016, between the Pokot and the Marakwet and which is getting intense with each passing day. Children are being orphaned and the elderly are fleeing their homes. Life has come to a stand still for the people while the National Government remains silent.&quot; The Cord leader who released a press statement from London, blamed the national government for failing to provide security saying security agencies on the ground were not providing the needed support.&quot;Security agencies on the ground seem incapable, immobilized and unwilling to provide the much-needed support and are content with just supervising the anarchy. It is our hope that the national government has not given up also on providing security to our citizens,&quot; Raila said.He continued, &quot;The President cannot afford to give up on a role that is distinctly his, of providing security to all Kenyans in every part of the country. We need a firm, fair and honest hand of the national government in Kerio Valley with immediate effect.&quot;Consequently, he said leaders from the two communities of Pokot and Marakwet communities should break their silence and speak boldly on the tragedy that has befallen their people.&quot;I recognize that on their own, the two communities have done all they can to bring peace to themselves through their elders, community-based organizations, youth and women groups. I appeal to the two communities to keep pushing for peaceful co-existence,&quot; Raila added.He noted: &quot;I also appeal to the two communities to appreciate themselves as victims of years of State neglect, massacres and marginalization. They should therefore stop fighting each other and instead jointly confront the national government with demands for their rightful share of development and compensation as recommended by the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission.&quot;Meanwhile, Young professionals from Marakwet demanded for the resignation of National Assembly chairman for Committee on Administration and National Security and Tiaty MP Asman Kamama, accusing him of taking sides on the issue.Led by chairman of the National Council of NGOs Mr Stephen Cheboi, the professionals said banditry in Kerio Valley has caused insecurity, perpetual poverty and displacement of women and children.Lives have been lost, property destroyed and scores have been injured and the residents are now calling upon the government to intervene.&quot;Cattle rustling by bandits from the neighboring county should be stopped immediately. People in the region are ambushed at night and this has prompted women and children to spend nights in caves with their children. School children are no longer going to school and businesses have also been affected as a result of the menace,&quot; said Cheboi.Since March this year, he said 30 people have been reported dead as a result of the cattle rustling and over 20, 000 displaced.He noted: &quot;Tot sub-county hospital has been closed and 150 school learning programmes disrupted. We call for safety of over 5000 students and teachers as they go for the end year exams. We want leaders from Baringo, West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet to come out strongly and preach peace.&quot;Constitution &amp; Reform Education Consortium (CRECO) Deputy director Joshua Chepkwony, also from the region blamed the government for laxity in solving the issue.&quot;Elected leaders from the region pour their anger in social media instead of approaching Interior Cabinet Secretary for help. The leaders have remained silent yet they announce in public that they are in government and they cannot provide a solution to cattle rustling which has caused loss of lives in the Kerio Valley,&quot; said Sammy Kiplimo, Kerio Valley resident.Kiplimo lamented that the displaced victims have never received any support from Red Cross or any relief agencies, a scenario which prompted residents from the region to distribute foodstuff, blankets and clothing to them.A local administration officer from the region told The Standard that despite the presence of security officers in the region, nothing much has been done to secure the residents.&quot;The leaders should take responsibility and come together to seek for solutions to this issue. We are tired of burying people who have died in the hands of cruel bandits. This week, we buried a young boy in his early 20s from Kasui village, who was killed in an ambush by the raiders. The government should provide a lasting solution so that residents can live in peace in their homes instead of living with caves with snakes,&quot; posed the local administration officer who requested for anonymity.
