Mombasa: If Neema Hamadi could have just one chance to talk to God one-on-one, she would ask, &quot;Why me Lord?&quot;At only 27 years of age and with three children suffering from a rare skin disorder, you could say life has not been kind to her.As if that was not enough, she left their father because of poverty and stigma.&quot;I used to live in Lunga Lunga in Kwale but I was forced to return to my parents in Likoni to help me after doctors said there was no cure for my children. They have also been discriminated against,&quot; she said.The three pupils are battling a rare, incurable genetic disorder that peels their skin whenever they&#39;re exposed to the sun.According to Ms Hamadi, the three - Fatuma, aged nine, Rukia, who is seven and five-year-old Hamadi - developed freckles and small lumps on their faces at the age of six months.&quot;It began like rashes before spreading to the whole body. Some people think it is witchcraft, a bad omen, some sort of punishment from God,&quot; she narrated tearfully.According to Coast General Hospital dermatologist Joash Matonda, the hereditary and incurable disease is called xeroderma pigmentosum or XP, which is a condition in which victims have a genetic defect that prevents their bodies from repairing skin damage from normal exposure to the sun&#39;s ultraviolet rays.&quot;Children with XP get the gene from both parents and it is prominent in cultures where members of the same genetic population reproduce,&quot; said Dr Matonda.Highly susceptibleHe explained that the victims are highly susceptible to skin cancers, adding that those over-exposed to the sun have a life span of 20 years while those who take precautionary measures can live up to 40 years.&quot;People with XP are 20,000 times more likely to get skin cancer if not protected from the sun unlike one out of five in normal people,&quot; he said.The disease has &quot;eaten away&quot; the skin around the cheeks, nose, lips and eyes of the three children and is spreading fast to the hands and neck.&quot;The condition robs the body of its ability to repair damage caused by the sun. It is incurable and the only way is for victims to cover themselves from the sun,&quot; he said, adding that people with the condition should apply sunscreen to reduce the damage caused by the sun&#39;s rays.He said folic acid was required to help in cell division while moisturisers soften the skin to prevent damage.The condition has burdened the family that lives in a region that experiences searing heat. Hamadi has been forced to stay home, jobless and without support from her estranged husband, to take care of the children who have also developed eyesight problems.Dr Matonda said about 25 per cent of patients with XP also had a neurological disorder that led to impaired hearing, spastic muscles or developmental delays.&quot;This condition has no cure. It is congenital just like albinism and is not infectious. For parents who are carriers, 25 per cent of their offspring are likely to be born with the condition and 50 per cent will be born carriers,&quot; he said.DNA testing can identify if a mother or father carries the gene. It can also determine if a child in the womb will have XP.
