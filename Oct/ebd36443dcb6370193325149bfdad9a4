All depends on the contents. If it doesn&#39;t change enough, we will maintain our opposition.&quot;European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs the collective body of the EU&#39;s leaders, will speak to Michel by late on Monday, EU sources said, before informing Trudeau&#39;s government of the state of play.&quot;If Michel says he is not in a position to confirm that Belgium will be able to sign on Thursday, then we won&#39;t have the summit,&quot; a source said.If postponed, no new summit date will be set, although the source said neither the EU nor Canada is willing to give up on a free trade pact that has been years in the making.Deadlock over what would be the EU&#39;s first with a Group of Seven country, overshadows prospects of completing similar deals with the United States or Japan and undermines a bloc already battered by Britain&#39;s vote to leave.German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel blamed the deadlock on a failure by the EU executive and Belgian federal government to allay the fears of some regions.&quot;Canada, Germany, and France had sought more contact with the Walloon government than those supposedly responsible in Brussels,&quot; he told Handelsblatt newspaper. &quot;The reasons for the Walloon protest lie in Brussels and not in Berlin.&quot;Supporters say the trade deal could boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada&#39;s by C$12 billion ($9 billion).
