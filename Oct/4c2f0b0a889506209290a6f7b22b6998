Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwamba ran into a hostile crowd outside a church in Mombasa when angry youths confronted him after a slip-up on his political alignment.They demanded that he declares his political affiliation after he gave a speech at Glory Worship Centre in Bangladesh within Jomvu constituency that appeared to indicate he was allied to Jubilee. While inside the church, the MP remarked &quot;we in Jubilee&quot; and quickly corrected the statement with &quot;we in Labour Party&quot; but some youths still called him a Jubilee mole as he tried to address them outside the church compound.His convoy drove off at top speed through Bangladesh slums with youths yelling and chasing after him.Namwamba began his tour of Coast on Saturday by addressing a rally in Ganze, Kilifi County.A large group of youths who got wind that Namwamba was a guest at the church camped outside and mobbed him as he left demanding handouts.Namwamba tried to address the youths but they became unruly and started demanding cash, forcing him to cut short his speech outside the church.The MP accused both national and county governments in regions facing famine of doing little to address the humanitarian crisis.Namwamba claimed Jubilee and CORD shared county governments almost on 50-50 ratio and blamed both coalitions for the famine raging about 14 counties in the country.COALITIONS DISHONEST&quot;Agriculture and water are functions of the county governments and it is dishonesty to blame only Jubilee while the two coalitions share county governments in the ratio of 50: 50,&quot; the Budalang&#39;i MP noted.He called on the national government to launch a special emergency fund and work closely with county governments in the affected regions to stem mass starvation.Namwamba said he was in Ganze in Kilifi County on Saturday and witnessed hundreds of residents going without food and water yet both national and county governments were doing little to salvage the situation.He was addressing Christians at the Glory Worship Centre yesterday where he attended Sunday mass together with party officials.The sermon was delivered by the Reverend Stephen Ouma.Yesterday, Namwamba claimed CORD counties have failed to deliver adding that it was a sign the Opposition coalition may not perform in case it came to power.
