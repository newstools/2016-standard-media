Kisumu: Five expectant mothers have died of malaria in three health facilities within one month. According to the health department, the number is the highest ever recorded in a single month in the last three years, and has become a concern given the massive investment made in the fight against the disease. According to Kisumu County malaria control Unit co-ordinator, Ms Lilyanna Dayo, the victims sought treatment when the malaria infection was at an advanced stage. She said the deaths were reported at Kombewa, Muhoroni and the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in the month of October. &quot;We have enough anti-malarial drugs in all the hospitals across the county, with over 90 per cent mosquito net cover and a number of community health workers, hence losing lives to malaria is a big worry to us,&quot; said Dayo. &quot;When an expectant mother dies, we lose two lives, hence we are very concerned with the deaths, especially when it is something which can be avoided,&quot; she added. Even though the mosquito net distribution in the county is at its highest number with over 90 per cent coverage, statistics from the National Malaria Control Unit indicate that only 40 per cent of the beneficiaries make good use of the nets. Dayo said the health department has moved to avert further deaths from the treatable disease, saying every pregnant woman attending antenatal clinic will now be tested for malaria, given free medication and a mosquito net. &quot;We have now instructed our community health workers to monitor the use of nets and anti-malarial drugs in their respective areas of coverage. We have also intensified advocacy and social mobilisation,&quot; she said.
