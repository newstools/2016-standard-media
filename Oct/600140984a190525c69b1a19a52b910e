Safaricom has unveiled a raft of products designed to enhance value for customers on its network. Subscribers who experience dropped calls will get a short message (SMS) notification and thereafter receive airtime compensation worth one minute.&nbsp;This service is however limited to calls within its network. In addition, the compensated one minute is also only available to usage within its network.&nbsp;The tools aim to hand customers more control on how they use voice, data or value added resources on the network. The telecommunications firm has also launched My Subscription application that allows customers to ably know which services they are subscribed and they can opt out at their own will. &nbsp;The service is meant to reduce complaints by subscribers who find out through airtime usage of their subscription to certain unsolicited subscriptions offered by third parties, which end up costing them.&ldquo;Following 90 days of gathering feedback from customers on the Safaricom Network Guarantee, the giant operator is pleased to announce updates to the service, which see the company provide customers with refunds should they encounter call drops on the network,&rdquo; notes a statement by the firm.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are on a journey to build the best network for our customers. So far, the Safaricom Network Guarantee has given us valuable insights that we are using to fine-tune our network,&rdquo; said Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore.
