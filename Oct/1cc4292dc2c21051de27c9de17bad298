Tana River Senator Ali Abdi Bule has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare current drought in parts of the country a national disaster. He warned that thousands of pastoralist families at the Coast and North Eastern risk starvation following the drying up of water points. Speaking yesterday in Parliament, Mr Bule said pronouncing the drought a national disaster will give it the seriousness it deserves and assist in mitigating and managing adverse effects. &ldquo;It is a national disaster and the national government should declare it so, because that is the only way well-wishers, including foreign aid donors can come in and assist the people suffering,&rdquo; said Bule.
