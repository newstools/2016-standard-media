CORD leader Raila Odinga says the exit of electoral commissioners has given the Opposition fresh hopes of removing Jubilee from power.Raila said yesterday said the electoral agency had been a stumbling block to the fight for change in the country, adding that with a new neutral electoral team, change was now inevitable. &ldquo;We have sent the IEBC commissioners home. We will continue to ensure there is level playing ground. There will be no more dead voters. We are now sure of beating Jubilee in the next elections,&rdquo; said Raila, referring to the exit of the nine Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission commissioners led by Issack Hassan.PREPARE VOTERSSpeaking at Kibigori in Muhoroni where he witnessed an elaborate ritual and peace-making ceremony between the Luo and their Nandi counterparts, Raila told local opposition leaders to ensure voters were well prepared in their areas as he handles Jubilee at the national level.&ldquo;I want you to concentrate down here. Let me deal with these people at the top. I know how to handle them. &ldquo;Ok ginyala malo kucha&rdquo; (I am smarter than them up there),&rdquo; said Raila.The former Prime Minister described the peace-making ceremony as a milestone in the relations between Luos and Nandis which, he said, was getting to its lowest ebb due to cross-border stock thefts and boundary disputes.Sporadic clashes along the border, which is endowed with rich agricultural soil and expansive grazing fields, have left many people dead, houses destroyed, school programmes disrupted and hundreds of animals stolen.In the recent flare-up two months ago, 10 people were killed, three schools shut for two weeks and several houses torched.BOLD MOVEKisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, local MPs Onyango K&rsquo;Oyoo, Fred Outa, Senator Anyang&rsquo; Nyong&rsquo;o and Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi attended yesterday&rsquo;s ceremony.Raila said he knew some would dismiss the ceremony but added that those who did not respect their cultures were doomed.A local medic who has been involved in philanthropic activities in the clash-torn border, Dr Hezron MacObwewa, praised the elders for their bold move to enforce peace but warned that only provision of jobs to the youths and revival of collapsed industries would ensure long-lasting peace.&ldquo;The youth go to fight their neighbours because they are idle and jobless. As leaders, we should engage them in income-generating activities,&rdquo; said Dr MacObewa.None of the MPs and Members of the County Assembly from Nandi County attended the function.
