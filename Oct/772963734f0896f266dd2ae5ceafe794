(Photo: AFP)Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Sunday defended his decision to host a visit by U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico, but he said it could have been carried out &quot;in a better way&quot;.The hastily arranged meeting of Trump and Pena Nieto on Aug. 31 sparked outrage in Mexico because of Trump&#39;s verbal attacks on Mexicans as well as his threats to build a border wall and tear up trade deals with Latin America&#39;s No. 2 economy.&quot;I faced a dilemma of &#39;yes or no&#39; once I had made the proposal and he said &#39;yes.&#39; Because, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about ensuring the best interests of Mexico, even if it could be very controversial, as it turned out to be,&quot; Pena Nieto said in an interview on Mexico&#39;s Canal 11 television.Pena Nieto had invited both Trump and his rival Hillary Clinton, who turned down the offer.&quot;Could we have done things better? Maybe yes, admittedly. I think that this genuine interest to bring about a meeting to take care of Mexico&#39;s interests, I think, could have been done in a better way,&quot; he said.During his visit, Trump struck a collaborative tone with Mexico. But as soon as he was back in the United States, he told a crowd in Arizona that Mexico would pay for his massive border wall &quot;100 percent.&quot;Backlash from the visit forced the resignation of Pena Nieto&#39;s finance minister and trusted aide Luis Videgaray, who had helped arrange the meeting.
