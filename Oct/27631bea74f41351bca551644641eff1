Residents have said failure to involve them in public projects has limited their capacity to fight corruption. The locals told the National Anti-Corruption Campaign Steering Committee sitting in Butere that the county administration only involved them in formulation but not implementation of projects. They used the Shiatsala Early Childhood Development Education centre to show how the county government used Sh2 million for the project but the community remained skeptical about it. The project management committee comprising members of the public, school administration and parents said they didn&#39;t know how the contractor was awarded the tender. Committee secretary Samuel Ndakala said the public was not happy with the contractor&#39;s work, adding that issues raised had not been addressed. The commission engaged the public on matters concerning leadership, integrity and anti-corruption, and provided them with the necessary support to combat and prevent graft.
