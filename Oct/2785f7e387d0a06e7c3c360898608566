A granddad who lost his right hand in a horrific work accident can finally hold and feel his young granddaughter&#39;s hand - thanks to a pioneering implant.Keith Vonderhuevel, from Ohio, US, was overjoyed when his sense of touch returned after he was fitted with an &#39;amazing&#39; new robotic hand.The implant was so good at sensory tasks that he was able to hold his five-year-old granddaughter&#39;s hand without squeezing too tight. The 50-year-old was also reportedly able to pick up and play with his two-year-old granddaughter, and reach for biscuits in a cookie jar.Mr Vonderhuevel had the pioneering implant fitted alongside a second man, Igor Spetic, who lost his right hand in a separate industrial accident.The two men were able to carry out such tasks as buttering toast and cracking eggs, researchers say.And the new sense of touch meant the pair could identify textures and distinguish different touch locations and pressure levels.Feedback in the form of electrical pulses that mimic pressure told Mr Vonderhuevel how tightly he grasped his older granddaughter&#39;s hand.&quot;And I can feel when she yanks her hand out,&quot; he said.At home, he used the prosthetic and his intact hand to pick up his younger granddaughter when she ran to him in his living room.&quot;Being able to grab her and feel I wasn&#39;t squeezing too tight and to play with her is amazing,&quot; he said.Normally, amputees receive no feedback from their prosthetics and don&#39;t like to shake hands, touch a face or hold a loved one for fear of hurting them.Mr Septic used his prosthetic hand to operate a lathe.He deftly turned the handle to shave different sections of a spinning aluminum bar to different diameters - trimming hundredths of an inch with each pass.&quot;I could feel the handle with the prosthetic hand and, instead of watching the hand, I watched the part - as you&#39;re supposed to,&quot; said Mr Spetic.He can also squeeze a line of ketchup on a hot dog without spilling, pick up eggs off the counter without breaking them, hold a heavy frying pan or dog on a leash and use yard tools.And so can Vonderhuevel.&quot;I squeeze harder if the object is harder or heavier, but if it&#39;s fragile, I stop squeezing as soon as I feel sensation,&quot; said Mr Spetic.Professor Sliman Bensmaia said without realistic, natural-feeling sensations, the devices will never come close to achieving the dexterity of human hands.He likened it to an accomplished pianist requiring a delicate touch - knowing how softly or forcefully to strike the keys based on sensory signals from the fingertips.He said without these signals, the sounds the instrument would make would not be very musical.Prof Bensmaia, of Chicago University, said: &quot;The idea is if we can reproduce those signals exactly the amputee won&#39;t have to think about it - he can just interact with objects naturally and automatically.&quot;Results from this study constitute a first step towards conveying finely graded information about contact pressure.&quot;Earlier this month, Prof Bensmaia and another team announced that for the first time, a paralysed patient was able to experience the sense of touch through a robotic arm controlled by electrodes implanted in his brain.The electrodes were placed in areas responsible for hand movements and touch, which allowed him to both move the robotic arm and feel objects through it.The latest research - also published in Science Translational Medicine - takes a similar approach with the two men.In this case, they were implanted with neural interfaces - devices embedded with electrodes that were attached to the median, ulnar and radial nerves of the arm.Those are the same nerves that would carry signals from the hand were it still intact.Prof Bensmaia said: &quot;If you want to create a dexterous hand for use in an amputee or a quadriplegic patient you need to not only be able to move it but have sensory feedback from it.&quot;To do this we first need to look at how the intact hand and the intact nervous system encodes this information, and then, to the extent that we can, try to mimic that in a neuroprosthesis.&quot;Study co-author Prof Dustin Tyler, of Case Western Reserve University , said: &quot;The ability to discriminate how hard you&#39;re applying pressure is key to complex manipulation of objects and for human interactions.&quot;Electrical stimulation gives the subjects in this research the same sensitivity to hold or press as you and I have.&quot;The system starts with pressure sensors on the prosthetic hand, sending signals to a portable stimulator.In turn, the stimulator sends electrical pulses to cuffs that encircle major nerve bundles in the arm - nerves that used to control the hand.Contact points on the cuffs transfer the electrical pulses, stimulating the nerves, which carry signals to the brain. The brain discerns different levels of intensity.Emily Graczyk, a PhD student in Prof Tyler&#39;s lab, found Mr Spetic and Mr Vonderhuevel can discern 20 distinct levels of intensity interpreted as pressure.Prof Tyler said the study could lead us to retrieving tactile information remotely - the way we use cameras to see remotely.In the future, the operator of a robotic explorer on the ocean floor or a bomb-squad robot could feel through the controls what the robots touch.Mr Vonderhuevel - who lost his right hand 11 years ago - said the new prosthetic system has enabled him to feel his loved ones&#39; hands.And he can also finally control the pressure he&#39;s exerting.He said: &quot;That&#39;s proven invaluable - my grandaughters - they&#39;ve grabbed a hold of my hand and they&#39;ve like a let go because I&#39;ve squeezed too tight.&quot;Now I can actually feel I&#39;m holding them and not squeezing too tight and when they give me a big hug that just gets to me.&quot;Prof Dustin Tyler, of Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, said: &quot;The electrical stimulation can mimic very close to what you have with your normal hand.&quot;The stimulated nerves carry signals to the brain which determines the intensity Keith feels doing things out in the kitchen like buttering toast or grabbing eggs and not smashing them.&quot;They may seem a little to some people but its big things to others - especially when you&#39;re missing a limb.&quot;Mr Vonderhuevel said: &quot;It used to be I would shake with my left hand - and now I feel a lot more confident with my right.&quot;I feel I&#39;m actually touching my grandaughters - and not the prosthetic. It makes a big difference - it&#39;s like destiny.&quot;
