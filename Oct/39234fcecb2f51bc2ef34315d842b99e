Would you dab urine on your face to make yourself look younger?The bizarre trend is a hot topic right now, much like Donald Trump &#39;s supposed tendency to grab things he ought not to, or killer clowns . Yes, these &#39;pee facials&#39; are more popular than you might think.In a bid to give themselves clearer, healthier-looking skin, people dab small amounts of their own urine onto their faces with cotton wool or a piece of cloth.The treatment is known as urotherapy and is usually done at home.
