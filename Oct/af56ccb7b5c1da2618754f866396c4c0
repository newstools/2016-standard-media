Ten members of the Kisumu County Assembly and their clerk have recorded statements with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) over misuse of Sh280 million.The MCAs and the assembly clerk spent most of Wednesday at the DCI headquarters in Kisumu where they were grilled regarding the loss of money meant for the Ward Development Fund. Part of the money was to be used on development projects in all the county&rsquo;s 35 wards.Meanwhile, Chief Officer for Roads and Infrastructure Samwel Otieno yesterday clarified that he was not among the officers who recorded statements on Wednesday.&ldquo;I was not among those who recorded statements. Nobody has asked me to record a statement,&rdquo; said Mr Otieno.SIX MEMBERSThe investigations have sparked tension in both the County Assembly and county executive, with anxiety building up over who would be next in line for interrogation.And a House committee formed to monitor the management of the Sh280 million ward development accounts will be reconstituted within the next 14 days.Speaker Ann Adul ruled unconstitutional the addition of six more members to make a total membership of 17.Ms Adul said the Act that created the fund stipulated that the committee was supposed to have 10 members and one chairperson.Last week, some MCAs turned the heat on the committee and questioned the inclusion of six more members.GREAT CONCERNIn a motion moved by Miwani MCA Maurice Ondiek and seconded by nominated MCA Bob Ndolo, the ward representatives noted that the committee was formed unconstitutionally.They argued that the House illegally adopted the inclusion of six members even though the Act that created the committee clearly stated that it should constitute only 11 members.East Seme MCA Aggrey Ogosi said the matter was of great concern and needed to be resolved as soon as possible.He noted that overhauling the committee would be crucial in helping to restore constitutional order in the House.The motion brought sharp divisions among MCAs, with some accusing its proposers of trying to block a report on the Sh105 million development fund under investigation from being tabled in the House.
