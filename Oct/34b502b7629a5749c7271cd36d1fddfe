A policeman accused of stealing Sh3.5 million from Tharaka Nithi Deputy Governor Eliud Mate has finally secured a cash bail. Josphat Kibiegon had been unable to raise the Sh500,000 cash bail or Sh1 million bond initially imposed by Principal Magistrate Stella Abuya last Friday. While his girlfriend and co-accused Rose Kajira was easily able to secure her bond, Kibiegon remained in remand because he had neither an available surety nor money to deposit as cash bail. It took his lawyer, Kiogora Mugambi, to convince the court to consider a personal finance guarantee provided by Kibiegon&#39;s uncle for him to be released. A personal guarantee is the equivalent of a cash bail. Mr Mugambi argued that Kibiegon was not a flight risk and as such, there was no need to impose stringent conditions.

The State, represented by Margaret Matheka, did not oppose the application. The policeman and his girlfriend denied robbing Mr Mate at gun point in Kinoru estate, Makutano township, on October 12. Kajira, a hospitality student at a local university, faces additional charges of handling stolen money.
