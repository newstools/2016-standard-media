The high turnout at the Machakos Municipal Stadium Thursday for Mashujaa Day celebrations illustrates willingness by Kenyans to embrace State functions as the Government devolves national holiday fetes.The jubilation and excitement rekindles the Government&rsquo;s plan to build ultra-modern stadia in some counties.Many counties do not have the capacity to stage national holiday ceremonies. Nakuru&rsquo;s Afraha Stadium hosted the Madaraka Day, the maiden national event to be held outside the capital city, which emerged as dress rehearsal for the other 45 counties, save for Nairobi, to host the events.Eldoret has the potential to host the event, especially after the refurbishment of the Kipchoge Keino Stadium, though most non-sporting events like political rallies are usually held at the 64 Stadium.The 64 Stadium has been hosting Uasin Gishu County national holiday events.It was only in 2007 when Kipchoge Keino Stadium hosted the triumphant World Athletics Championships team from Osaka, Japan, during the homecoming ceremony.Interestingly, most of the cities and towns poised to host national holiday functions are those that host the Kenya Premier League matches &ndash; except&nbsp; Eldoret &ndash; which doesn&rsquo;t have a team in top flight football.In Mombasa, the second largest city after Nairobi, has been hosting major events since independence but not a national holiday fete.It now braces itself to host the fetes, thanks to President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s announcement to have a rotational routine of the ceremonies.Mombasa County Executive for Sports Mohammed Abbas says Mombasa stadium, which is under construction, would be able to host major events once completed.In Kisumu, the Kenyatta Sports grounds has the capacity of hosting over 30,000 people but the number can be more depending on preparations.Apart from Kenyatta Sports Ground, Mamboleo grounds that has previously been used by Prophet David Owuor for crusades can host huge crowd.Other grounds that can hold high number of people are Kisumu Polytechnic that can host more than 200,000 people and Kirembe Grounds along the Busia Road. Kirembe does not have gates and there must be prior preparations and proper security arrangements for a State function.Another ground that can host a high-profile event is the Tom Mboya College grounds that was used to host the Governors Summit. It hosted over 5,000 guests in a ceremony that was officiated by the president a year ago.Most counties in far-flung regions may not host national celebrations any time soon because of poor infrastructure.But some counties like Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo and Nandi are grading their stadia in readiness for sports events and the national fetes as well.Reports by Jonathan Komen, Philip Orwa and Ernest Ndunda
