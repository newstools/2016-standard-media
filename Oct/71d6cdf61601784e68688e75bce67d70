He regretted that most counties charged exorbitant fees and consequently discouraged would-be traders from venturing into business.Speaking at the official opening of the Bungoma International Investment Conference Wednesday, Mr Mohammed called on counties to put in place measures that would attract both local and international investors.&ldquo;The continued heavy charges scare away investors who are ready to venture into different fields. The taxes should be friendly and affordable,&rdquo; he said.Attract investors&ldquo;All counties are looking for opportunities to attract investors. The devolved units that will succeed are those where taxes are minimised to give traders room to work in a friendly environment,&rdquo; he said.The CS pointed out that businesses only thrived where traders were peaceful and worked in a friendly environment.He noted that Kenya has been ranked third among most improved countries in Africa in terms of having a good business working environment.The ranking survey was conducted in 189 countries and showed improvements in Kenya.&ldquo;In the last one year, Kenya has improved from number 92 to 44 in the World Bank Development Index, which is commendable. Many Kenyans should now work hard so that the country can move a bit higher next year,&rdquo; he added.He called on counties to improve in several sectors, key among them agriculture, roads, mining, co-operatives and education.Governor Ken Lusaka said the conference would accord the county a unique opportunity to showcase development programmes, present investment proposals and cement working partnerships with the private sector.He pointed out that exhibitors and delegates, both local and international, had a chance to showcase their wares as well as network and benefit from strategic partnerships and exchange and transfer knowledge and financing.&ldquo;The shift in the political tectonic plates that followed the establishment of devolved units has been accompanied by boisterous changes in the socio-economic sphere,&rdquo; said Mr Lusaka.The governor noted that Kenya was witnessing the development of mini-economies within devolved units as demonstrated in Bungoma.&ldquo;Our development strategy is underpinned in our County Integrated Development Plan, and we have made tremendous gains; but much more ought to be done. The world transformation agenda now defines the &lsquo;Future we Want&rsquo; through Sustainable Development Goals,&rdquo; he said.He said infrastructure was a key enabler to development and that shaky infrastructure had both social and economic costs and considerably slowed down economic growth.&ldquo;It is worth noting that my administration has to date developed a road network of more 137km, an integrated solid waste management plan and enabled 60 per cent access to water in the county,&rdquo; said Lusaka.The governor assured that the county would seek to wipe out boundaries and barriers in a global economy through enhanced integration and partnerships.It would also build relations to spur industrialisation, create jobs, alleviate poverty and realise the shared obligation of improved living standards for all residents.Also present were Woman Representative Reginalda Wanyonyi and Deputy Governor Hillary Chongwony.
