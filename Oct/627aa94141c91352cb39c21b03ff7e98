Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday dismissed claims that he will enter into political deals with Jubilee Party.He said his statement last weekend that he must be in the next administration did not mean he was keen to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s government. Kalonzo spoke on the same day that Ford Kenya party leader and CORD co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula brushed off claims of discord in the Opposition coalition.Wetang&rsquo;ula said the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy&rsquo;s three principals cannot speak the same language all the time, but would always arrive at a consensus.Earlier yesterday, Kalonzo told journalists that he would remain in CORD&nbsp; and was most likely to clinch the nomination to be the coalition&rsquo;s flagbearer.Don&rsquo;t celebrateSpeaking at the party&rsquo;s headquarters when he awarded membership certificates to Wiper members, Kalonzo told Jubilee supporters not to start celebrating, thinking that he was about to join them.&ldquo;When I said I must be in the next government, other people started saying the next government is Jubilee. But I meant the government that I shall lead. This cannot and will not be the Jubilee administration,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.The former Vice President&rsquo;s previous statement had triggered reactions in some quarters, with Jubilee supporters reaffirming that they were ready to work with him.It came as the future of CORD came into question following a series of rallies by each of the political parties in the coalition &mdash; the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper and Ford Kenya.Calls by ODM point men to have Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho installed as party leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s running mate triggered more reactions before Joho announced on Thursday that he would not be Raila&rsquo;s deputy.Reports of a fallout among the corporate political parties were fuelled further when ODM leaders accused Wetang&rsquo;ula of using very strong language to criticise Raila during Ford-K rallies.However, speaking in Vihiga yesterday, the Bungoma senator assured CORD supporters that the coalition had a winning team and one of its principals would be nominated to vie for the presidency in the General Election.&ldquo;We have a unity of purpose. Our main aim is to wrestle Jubilee government out of power. We know where we have come from and we know where we are going together as CORD,&rdquo; said Wetang&rsquo;ula.&ldquo;Having come this far together as CORD principals, Kenyans should not be worried of any discord. It gets more difficult when all of us believe we are strong candidates to represent the coalition in the next General Election.&rdquo;The Senate minority leader senator journalists at Sosa Cottages after meeting delegations of Vihiga County elders at a consultative forum.The elders, led by Edward Ohare, said they would support any of the CORD candidates nominated to run for president. And if it is Wetang&rsquo;ula, they would encourage him to work with Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi.Mr Ohare said some leaders from the region were working with others to handle modalities for the CORD presidential nomination. He said the leaders include Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, MPs Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren) and Chris Wamalwa (Kiminini) and Cynthia Mutere.Not distractedWetang&rsquo;ula said they would not be distracted and join others.&ldquo;Already we have strong pillars to build a house, why should we go for weaker pillars that will build a weak house,&rdquo; he said.Statements by Wetang&rsquo;ula and Kalonzo have been supported by other leaders in the Opposition.Wiper chairman David Musila said Jubilee supporters had no reasons to start celebrating, expecting that Kalonzo would marshal his political supporters to JP.&ldquo;When I stated (at the Tononoka rally on Sunday) that the party had an option, the option was not and cannot be Jubilee. We have options, of course. Who does not have a Plan A or a Plan B? Jubilee please, give us space, we do not need you. We will never come to you!&rdquo; said the Kitui senator.&ldquo;Our followers must know that we are in Cord to stay and if any option is to be considered, it will never be Jubilee.&rdquo;
