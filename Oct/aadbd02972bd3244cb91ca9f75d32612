Work on the Kapsokwony-Kaberwa-Chepkitale road is set to kick off, opening up for tourism the area that has long been neglected.Speaking during this year&#39;s Mt Elgon Jumbo Charge in Labot Sunday night, Governor Ken Lusaka said the major part of the road had been put under murram.&ldquo;These are the fruits of devolution; that is why this time round we took 40 minutes unlike last year when we spent about eight hours on the same stretch,&rdquo; he said. The Bungoma County Boss said that by putting murram on the remaining bit of the road, Mt Elgon would be more conducive for tourism. He said that the county government will help the community build more cottages, preserve the local&#39;s rich culture and boost environmental conservation to attract more visitors.This year&#39;s Jumbo Charge attracted more than 100 competitors from as far Kisumu, Uasin Gishu, Nairobi, among other regions. With increased investment in infrastructure from the county government, it is expected that next year&#39;s competition could attract participants from Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan.The project is a motor challenge geared towards wildlife conservation, and in particular, elephants and the Mt Elgon ecosystem.&ldquo;We are putting up a health centre that will be fully equipped with all facilities to ease access to medical care by the members of the Chepkitale community and other visitors,&rdquo; said the Deputy Governor Hillary Chongwony.With the County expected to host an international investment conference this week, one of the attractive investment baits is the putting up of a modern hotel in Chepkitale.
