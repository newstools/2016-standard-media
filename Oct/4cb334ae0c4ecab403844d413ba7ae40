When their shops stood side-by-side they were the best of friends.They scrimped and saved to go on &shy;holidays and offered each other help and advice if times were tough.Back then, &pound;250 here and there was the difference between sinking and swimming for the likes of Kym Mills and her fellow traders Adrian and Gillian Bayford. Until 2012, that is &ndash; when the Bayfords scooped &pound;148million on the Euromillions .Life changed forever, the Bayfords went on to become landlords for Kym and her daughter but the friendship has turned toxic in a row over a monthly rent rise... of &pound;250.Now disabled Kym has been evicted from a house owned by 45-year-old Adrian , who split from Gillian, 43, in 2013.Yet it would take barely 30 minutes for &pound;148million to generate interest of &pound;250.In an interview today Kym also claims they fell out big time after she helped sell items from his 90-acre estate.She said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just hurt &ndash; they were my best friends. And at the end of the day they&rsquo;ve got it all and I&rsquo;ve lost everything. I wish none of this had ever happened.&ldquo;Life was so much simpler before. This money split my friends up and ruined the relationship we had. I&rsquo;ve got stuck in the middle of it and it&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;Kym, 54, met the Bayfords in 2009 as her clothing shop was next door to the second-hand record store Adrian, 46, ran in Haverhill, near Cambridge.When times were tough Kym says she offered a friendly ear to Adrian and Gillian, 44.She said: &ldquo;We used to go for coffees and I helped Gillian out with her baby.&quot;I used to confide in her and she did the same with me. We were just friends. It was lovely.&rdquo;Kym claimed she also sold stuff in her shop for Gillian, adding: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a soft touch &ndash; I think if someone needs a helping hand I wouldn&rsquo;t think twice about it.&rdquo;As Kym&rsquo;s business grew she moved out to find bigger premises, but her fortunes later changed and she ended up closing.She was still in touch with the Bayfords when their lives changed forever in 2012.Gillian said at the time the money was &ldquo;something to share with people that need help, people that have helped us and supported us&rdquo;.And she was good to her word &ndash; offering Kym a &pound;500-a-month home in an outbuilding on their estate.A cleaning job was thrown in, which helped Kym as she is limited to 16 hours&rsquo; work a week due to a painful spine condition and epilepsy .Daughter Keera, 23, who drives her mum around in a mobility car, also moved in.Keera said: &ldquo;It was great &ndash; Gillian really helped by giving us a place.&quot;We were struggling and they offered us a chance to start again. It seemed like a real lifeline.&rdquo;But just 15 months after the Lotto win Adrian and Gillian&rsquo;s marriage fell apart.She moved to Scotland to be with an Audi salesman who had sold her a fleet of cars, while Adrian agreed to continue employing Kym and honour the tenancy agreement.Adrian found a new love in Samantha Burbidge, a stable girl 16 years his junior.Keera said: &ldquo;Mum even started working in the farm shop that Adrian and his new partner Sam set up.&quot;She had a little golf buggy Adrian lent her to get around in. She and Sam would spend time together and go for lunches.&quot;They were all incredibly close. We used to go round for barbecues.&quot;My uncle moved into another house on site and we even spent Christmas with Adrian and his family. We had a great time. It was like an extended family.&rdquo;Kym said: &ldquo;Adrian has been here when I collapsed and been taken off by ambulance. His fiancee visited in hospital. We were so close.&rdquo;But things turned sour this year. Adrian and Sam, 30, closed the farm shop on their Cambridgeshire estate and moved stock to a &pound;1.5million equestrian arena in Norfolk he bought for her.Other items were to be sold by Kym on their behalf.Keera said: &ldquo;There were some buckets for horse feed and somebody asked if they could buy them.&quot;She told them she didn&rsquo;t know how much Sam wanted, but if they took them they could sort the money out later.&quot;Sam started accusing mum of giving stuff away. She tried to explain what had happened but she got hostile towards us.&rdquo;Kym says Adrian eventually asked for the cleaner&rsquo;s set of keys to his &pound;6million home back &ndash; and the keys to the golf buggy.In June, a letter told Kym and Keera the rent would rise from &pound;500 to &pound;750 a month.Kym was earning &pound;8 an hour as Adrian&rsquo;s cleaner and could not afford the new rate.Keera said: &ldquo;He knows Mum can&rsquo;t afford &pound;750 a month &ndash; he&rsquo;s the one paying her.&quot;I work in a pharmacy down the road and we just can&rsquo;t afford that much.&ldquo;If it had been a gradual increase we might have been able to prepare for it, but all of a sudden he wanted 50 per cent more.&ldquo;We tried to challenge it, but next thing we knew he sent us an eviction notice.&rdquo;Adrian is entitled to reclaim possession of the house and on Friday the pair moved out.They are staying with pals while they wait for a council house.Meanwhile, they say Adrian is building a swimming pool just yards from their old front door.Keera said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just really sad. Adrian used to visit mum to check up on her, but made it very clear we&rsquo;re not welcome here any more.&rdquo;Kym added: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t trust each other any more and it&rsquo;s so sad. All he kept saying is &lsquo;it&rsquo;s business, it&rsquo;s business&rsquo;.&quot;Well it might be, but there&rsquo;s a way of doing things when that business is with your friends.&rdquo;Adrian yesterday insisted he had done nothing wrong and said he had been generous to Kym and Keera for years.He said: &ldquo;They were given money when we first won, but Kym gave my stuff away for free. She was giving away &pound;90 pairs of boots for nothing.&ldquo;I took them out for meals, they came out with me for drinks. I treated them like family and they&rsquo;re doing this to me.&ldquo;They thought they were here for life, but things happen, things move on. It&rsquo;s a business.&quot;Some people don&rsquo;t realise how lucky they are. They had three years of very cheap rent.&quot;When I first came here that house was rented for &pound;1,500 a month. They had it for &pound;500. I was subsidising their rent.&quot;Of course rent goes up &ndash; but it&rsquo;s still half of what it would have been. It costs money to run an estate like this.&quot;I&rsquo;ve got 45 people working for me and it costs money. I&rsquo;m not a charity.&rdquo;He also said Kym and Keera would have been homeless three years ago if he hadn&rsquo;t kept the house after his split from Gillian.Adrian turned a blind eye to them staying in the property beyond the August 31 eviction date.Kym has been off work sick for a few months and recently handed in her notice.Adrian said: &ldquo;Some people don&rsquo;t realise they&rsquo;ve been put in a very lucky situation.&ldquo;Kym has handed in her notice. Fair enough &ndash; there was always going to be a job if she wanted to carry on.&quot;But she got an attitude. Ask anybody else I deal with how fair I am. I do loads for charity.&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s too short. If this is how they feel it proves what mentality they&rsquo;ve got. How can I be friends with them any more?&rdquo;And he added: &ldquo;Philip Green &ndash; go and chase him. This is trivial.&rdquo;
