Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.&quot;What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,&quot; said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. &quot;You&rsquo;re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.&quot;You&rsquo;re not fighting Syria any more, you&rsquo;re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,&quot; he said.Clinton&#39;s campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.&quot;Once again, he is parroting Putin&#39;s talking points and playing to Americans&#39; fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,&quot; Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement.Trump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago and said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.&quot;Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,&quot; he said.&nbsp;OBAMA FOCUSED &#39;ON HIS GOLF GAME&#39;On Russia, Trump again knocked Clinton&#39;s handling of U.S.-Russian relations while secretary of state and said her harsh criticism of Putin raised questions about &quot;how she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil,&quot; if she wins the presidency.On the deterioration of ties with the Philippines, Trump aimed his criticism at Obama, saying the president &quot;wants to focus on his golf game&quot; rather than engage with world leaders.Since assuming office, Duterte has expressed open hostility toward the United States, rejecting criticism of his violent anti-drug clampdown, using an expletive to describe Obama and telling the United States not to treat his country &quot;like a dog with a leash.&quot;The Obama administration has expressed optimism that the two countries can remain firm allies.Trump said Duterte&#39;s latest comments showed &quot;a lack of respect for our country.&quot;The interview comes two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, with Trump trailing badly in the polls. He repeated his assertion that the &quot;media is rigging the polls&quot; and said his supporters were upset with Republican Party leadership.&quot;The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win 100 percent if we had support from the top. I think we&rsquo;re going to win it anyway.&quot;He said if he wins he would not consider putting Democrats in his cabinet but would work with them on legislation.
