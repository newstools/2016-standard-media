Three more families from Nyeri are mourning the Tuesday dawn killing of their relatives in an attack on a guest house in Mandera, bringing the total accounted deaths to seven. Chaka, which is renown in Nyeri for quarry work, has born the brunt of terror attacks in Mandera, which have killed more than 40 people. By Wednesday morning, the family of Joseph Muriuki Maina, 50, was yet to come to terms with his death. In a strange twist of fate, the same family lost a brother-in-law last year in a similar attack against quarry workers who had migrated to the volatile region for casual work. When The Standard visited the homestead in Gatei village, about five kilometres from Chaka, Nancy Wanjiru Maina, Muriuki&#39;s sister, and her sister-in-law Ann Wairimu could not hold back their tears as they tried to deal with their grief. Ms Wanjiru lost a brother-in-law in another attack last year.

He went to Mandera two years ago and only came back recently to attend a neighbour&#39;s funeral before leaving again,&quot; said Wanjiru. She described her brother as a hardworking and sociable man. &quot;Why did they kill him? As a family, we can only forgive the killers and pray that they will change their ways,&quot; she said. Wanjiru said her husband, Anthony Ndamburi, also worked in the quarries in Mandera. &quot;My husband is also in Mandera but he is safe. I spoke with him by phone on Tuesday and he assured me that he was safe,&quot; she said as she wiped the tears that rolled down her cheeks. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
