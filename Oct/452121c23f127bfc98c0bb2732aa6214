DT Dobie has opened its showrooms for the new Mercedes E-class four-door luxury saloon that will give customers a choice from three models.The latest E-class that blends stylish designs, advanced technology and appealing road experience is expected to hot up competition for other brands on the market that target high-end buyers. Customers will choose from E200, E250 and E300 models depending on their preferences. While E200 has a two-litre 184 horsepower petrol engine, E250 has 211 horsepower while for E300 it has a 242 horsepower.According to the distributors, this feature makes them more economical than their predecessor models. Buyers will be offered a choice of exclusive line with a classic radiator grille and Mercedes star on the bonnet. This will be bold on the front to easily distinguish these models from others.To enhance safety, the new models have pre-safe impulsive side which ensures that upon the car detecting a side collision, the vehicle&rsquo;s seat will inflate the side bolsters. This will help move the occupant towards the centre of the vehicle to minimise the effects of the crash. The models, which were launched yesterday at Nairobi&rsquo;s Arboretum are available at Lusaka Road and Westlands offices as well as at the firm&rsquo;s branches in Mombasa, Nakuru and Kisumu.The introduction of the latest models follows the launch of seven different Mercedes Benz SUVs earlier this year.These range from the compact GLA to the large and luxurious GLS and are equipped with fuel efficient petrol engines and 4-MATIC intelligent 4X4 drive systems.
