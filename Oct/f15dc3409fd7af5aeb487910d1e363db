Team GB&#39;s record-breaking Rio Olympic and Paralympic squads have attracted 150,000 fans in the streets of Manchester for their victory parade.Around 350 athletes from the Rio 2016 Games featured in this afternoon&#39;s festivities, including the likes of Jessica Ennis-Hill, Nicola Adams, Ellie Simmonds, Max Whitlock and the Brownlee brothers.Fans braved the rain from the Museum of Science and Industry and end in Albert Square streets with London set for its own parade in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday. Britain&#39;s most decorated Olympian, Sir Bradley Wiggins, was absent from today&#39;s celebration and has confirmed that he will not attend tomorrow&#39;s event in the capital either.This comes after Wiggins - who has not attended such an event since 2004 - was embroiled in a controversy surrounding his use of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) and pulled out of the Abu Dhabi Tour.Mo Farah, who completed a second 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic double in Rio was also absent, as were Jason and Laura Kenny, who are on their honeymoon after they got married following their heroics at the velodrome in Rio.Thousands of people waited hours ahead of the 4.30pm start with Olly Murs and Rebecca Ferguson set to perform at the event&#39;s close.Britain finished second in the meddle table at the Olympics, winning 67 medals, including 27 golds as they exceeded their medal target in Rio.It was a similar story during the Paralympics, as Britain also finished second, claiming 147 medals, 64 of which were gold.
