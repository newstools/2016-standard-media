Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amb Amina Mohammed has rallied Universal Postal Union member countries to vote for Bishar Hussein for a second term as Director General of the Switzerland-based global body.Speaking during a luncheon hosted for delegates attending the 26th UPU Congress 2016 in Istanbul, CS Amina said Kenya believes the experience Amb Hussein had acquired as Director-General of the UPU over the last four years will be useful in navigating the UPU successfully into the future. &quot;We are requesting for your support for another mandate for Amb Hussein. Under his leadership, the International Bureau of the UPU has delivered over 98 percent of the Doha Postal Strategic objectives and has been a great advocate and spokesman for the UPU and under his watch the organization is more visible and successful,&quot; said Amina.The CS said Kenya was also seeking support for its candidatures in the UPU Council of Administration and in the Postal Operations Council. &quot;I am pleased to inform you that all these positions enjoy the full support and endorsement of the Heads of State and Government Summit of the African Union. We are keen to continue participating actively in UPU affairs including in shaping its future direction,&quot; said CS Amina.Saying Kenya was a strong believer in multilateralism and cooperation as critical ingredients for the promotion of international peace, prosperity and security, CS Amina added that the country had a long-standing tradition of engagement at the global arena.Present during the luncheon was Information, Communications and Technology Cabinet Secretary, Joe Mucheru, Principal Secretary, Broadcasting and Telecommunication Sammy Itemere, Kenya&#39;s ambassador to Turkey, Kiema Kilonzo, Communication Authority of Kenya (CA) Director General Francis Wangusi, and Chairman of UPU Congress Kenan Bozgeyik among others.The UPU Congress brings together representatives of governments, designated operators, regulators and restricted unions of UPU member countries, as well as heads of UN and other international organisations.
