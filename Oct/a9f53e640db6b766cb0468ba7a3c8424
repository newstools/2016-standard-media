The Tourism Regulation Authority (TRA) has conducted the first classification of hotels in Uasin Gishu County in 13 years. Hotel and restaurant classification has been a challenge for regulation agencies due to resistance from investors in the sector.TRA Director General Kipkorir Lagat said efforts to classify hotels in the past decade had failed due to resistance and unwillingness by hoteliers and other stakeholders.&ldquo;It was wonderful for the North Rift to pioneer this vital procedure. An in-depth engagement with investors in the hospitality industry, creating awareness and building capacity for the stakeholders prior to the categorisation ensured we attained this milestone,&rdquo; said Mr Lagat.He said classified facilities that have been gazetted will benefit from free advertising and publicity on the Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) website.They will also enjoy duty-free importation of 11 hotel items, including linen, to enable them to maintain and even upgrade their standards.&ldquo;The exercise is ongoing across the East African Community and will enable us to assure clients of value for their money. Some facilities have been overcharging clients and promising services they don&rsquo;t deliver,&rdquo; added Lagat.Out of 126 facilities that initially sought free classification, 11 hotels got a two-star rating. Only Boma Inn Hotel in Eldoret received a four-star rating based on quality of service, accommodation capacity, variety of services and calibre of staff.Samich Resort and Kerio View Lodge in Elgeyo Marakwet, and The Noble Conference Centre and Hotel Horizon in Uasin Gishu got three-star rating although the latter closed down several months ago following a financial crisis.Certificate and plaqueComfy Hotel, Kenmosa Tourist Hotel, Poa Place Resort, Starbucks Hotel, Cicada, Hotel Winstar and The Pearl Hotel, all in Uasin Gishu, got a two-star rating and were awarded a certificate and a plaque showing their categories.&ldquo;We are currently classifying the facilities voluntarily but it will soon be a compulsory exercise and those that fail to utilise the free service will have to pay Sh50,000 to be rated,&rdquo; said Lagat.He said poor sanitation and lack of qualified, high-calibre staff as the main challenge for many hotels, a situation that had caused resistance to vetting and rating from some renowned hotels.Lagat noted that the North Rift region, which lies within the Western Kenya Tourism Circuit, is well-placed to develop the industry further through its diverse opportunities.
