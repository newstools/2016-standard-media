&nbsp;Without money, however, their options were looking pretty limited and very dull. As they glanced down at their phones in the hopes of finding a miracle, one of the students came across a text message he had received from M-Shwari, a mobile loans product that had launched a year earlier.

She is also a model, motivational speaker, event host, actress, visual artist, dancer, poet, singer and youth activist. &ldquo;All l want to do is prepare young people to grasp or create opportunities for themselves and change their lives,&rdquo; she said.For her, most young people are suffering, not because of a lack of opportunities, but because they do not have information on what is available.And she should know &ndash; Ms Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a has achieved a lot in her life, despite growing up in a slum in Nairobi&rsquo;s Kangemi.Sleepless nightsWhen she was nine, her dream was to become a television presenter so she could engage with her community. It was a dream largely inspired by watching TV anchor Janet Mbugua, who was at the time on KTN, as well as international stars Tyra Banks and Oprah Winfrey.Her parents knew education is an equaliser, so they did their best to take her to school.&ldquo;The fact that l was a bright pupil made my parents spend sleepless nights figuring out how to pay my fees,&rdquo; she said.And she did not waste their efforts. Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a studied hard and got marks high enough to get into top-ranked Precious Blood Girls High School Riruta.However, aware that it may be beyond her parents&rsquo; abilities to handle the increase in fees &ndash; she is the first of three children &ndash; Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a applied for a scholarship from Akili Dada. The organisation had visited her school and encouraged students who needed it to apply for financial aid.Her application, however, was unsuccessful. The organisation was looking for students who had demonstrable leadership skills, were involved in their communities and had good grades.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, not one to lose hope easily, decided to do what needed to be done to qualify the following year.Work ethicTo improve her leadership skills and improve her engagement with her community, she began volunteering with PACE Kenya, which works to improve access to education, and teaching English in schools in the slums through Nafisika Trust. In academics, Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a paid extra attention to the sciences she was weak in, and started a research club at her school.The following year, her application for an Akili Dada scholarship was successful, and she joined the organisation.It is here that she met media personalities anchors, including Janet Mbugua, Kalekye Mumo and Victoria Rubadiri, who mentored her and taught her about discipline, work ethics and other principles that she passes on to the youth she engages with today.She also got an opportunity to work with Women Girls Lead Global, an organisation that amplifies the voices of women in leadership, as a film facilitator.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a soon achieved her dream of becoming a TV presenter, hosting a show dubbed The Chartlist on TV-Cosmopolitan.&ldquo;I played all types of music and discussed issues affecting the youth like early marriages, drug abuse, abortion and other criminal activities,&rdquo; she said. She has since left the show to pursue other interests, but promises to get back on TV again.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a&rsquo;s work with the youth most recently caught Safaricom&rsquo;s attention, which approached her to participate in mentorship forums around its Blaze sub-brand.She also works with other youth-oriented initiatives, including Young Possible, a company by the youth for the youth that provides a networking platform for entrepreneurs, and Girls Have Dreams that empowers the girl child.And beyond our borders, Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a was named the 2016 Segal Young Rockstar by the Segal Family Foundation in Uganda for her mentorship efforts that aim to reduce youth unemployment.Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a believes her achievements are a result of her focusing on what she wants to be. Her advice to other young, enterprising Kenyans is to grab opportunities as soon as they turn up.&ldquo;Do not wait to get a degree before you start seeking opportunities. As soon as you start taking yourself seriously, people will take you seriously,&rdquo; she said.Grab opportunitiesNg&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a, who describes herself as a God-fearing, hardworking dreamer and doer, is currently pursuing a degree in economics and statistics from the University of Nairobi. She says she juggles her many duties by managing her time well.&ldquo;I study on weekdays, and give music, modelling and other entertainment duties my Saturdays; I reserve Sundays for my family. I write my poems at night as the inspiration strikes.&rdquo;And though she has achieved plenty in a short amount of time, Ng&rsquo;ang&rsquo;a is quick to clarify it has not been easy.&ldquo;I have sacrificed a lot &ndash; both money and time &ndash; to give all I do my best,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;And this is just the beginning. I have a long way to go in terms of youth initiatives and education.&rdquo;nwamuswa@standardmedia.co.ke
