Kwale Senator Boy Juma Boy has claimed the Jubilee government wants to unfairly exploit minerals in the area.Addressing Dzombo ward elders on Friday, Mr Boy claimed a top Jubilee leader had acquired 3,000 acres in Kwale under unclear circumstances.&ldquo;We are still investigating to find out why he acquired the land and if it was grabbed or bought and if bought, was it worth the price he paid?&rdquo; he said. The senator also claimed some leaders in the ruling coalition want to grab land whose leases have expired or are about to expire.But Kwale Land and Natural Resources Executive Ali Mafimbo said the claims by Boy were baseless.
