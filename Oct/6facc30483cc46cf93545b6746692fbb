Former Gatanga Member of Parliament&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;has officially stepped down from the 2017 presidential election race.Instead, Mr&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;said he will be vying for a gubernatorial seat and back President Uhuru Kenyatta in his re-election bid. However, the former MP refused to categorically state which county he will be seeking to contest for the gubernatorial seat and only mentioned that Nairobi deserves better leadership than what it has. Apart from Nairobi,&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;has been linked to Murang&#39;a County.Speaking at a church service in St Teresa Catholic Church in Eastleigh, Nairobi,&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;said the presentation of coalition as the vehicle in the next general election has made it impossible for him to join in the race.&quot;The 2017 elections have created a notion of coalitions contesting each other which leaves very little space for someone like me. I will therefore not be running for presidency in the next election,&quot; said&nbsp;Kenneth.He said despite having vied in 2013 where he emerged fourth, he feels it is not the right time to get engaged again in a presidential race: &quot;But the dream is still valid and very much alive.&quot;A possibility of vying in 2022 was also shelved with&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;saying it is &#39;too early&#39; to start thinking of such: &quot;For now we need a leader who will hold this country together. And as for me, I will be supporting President Kenyatta for his re-election.&quot;Kenneth&nbsp;said he has been approached by electorates from three counties among them Nairobi who want him to represent them but he is yet to make the final decision.&quot;It may be Murang&#39;a, Nakuru or even Nairobi. We are free to offer our leadership anywhere. I am from Nairobi but I had a chance to be an MP for Gatundu,&quot; he said.Nairobi senator Mike Sonko has already welcomed&nbsp;Kenneth&#39;s interest in the Nairobi gubernatorial race expressing high hopes of him joining the ruling administration adding that he is ready to work with him.If this happens, then&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;will be adding to the long list of Jubilee gubernatorial aspirants among them Sonko himself, Dagoretti MP Dennis Waweru, and Margaret Wanjiru setting stage for a tougher nomination process.&quot;I am ready to work with the former Gatanga MP if he joins Jubilee Party and participate in the free and fair Jubilee party nominations,&quot; said Sonko.He added: &quot;Let Nairobi residents welcome and accommodate other aspirants who will declare their bid for the Governor&#39;s seat since our ultimate goal as Jubilee Party is to win the seat and make Nairobi better a place.&quot;Kenneth&nbsp;noted that Nairobi needs a more focused leader than what it has: &quot;This County deserves better leadership and if I am called upon to action, I will gladly offer myself. But I am still consulting.&quot;Area Member of County Assembly Andrew Macharia allied to the Jubilee Party said the current governor Dr Evans Kidero has dilapidated the city to even worse status: &quot;We have no doubt that&nbsp;Kenneth&nbsp;can redeem the lost glory of this county.&quot;
