The audit report calling for reduction of the number of MPs and Members of County Assembly has triggered debate on constitutional amendment.A day after the report by a committee commissioned by National Assembly&rsquo;s Budget and Appropriation Committee and chaired by by Auditor-General Edward Ouko was made public, some leaders have called for an amendment to the Constitution to review the system of representation.The audit unveiled on Thursday found that Kenyans are over-represented, making implementation of the Constitution difficult as it was too costly. During the Speaker&rsquo;s Roundtable meeting, that brought together the leadership of the National Assembly and members of the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, the leaders welcomed the report, saying it required urgent attention to reduce the burden of Kenyans.Speaker Justin Muturi said the report provided Kenyans with &ldquo;food for thought&rdquo; on possible changes they may consider making in the long run to ensure implementation of the Constitution is affordable.He said the report will be subjected to public debate for Kenyans to decide what needs to be done.&ldquo;If you look at what we gave ourselves in 2010, in the light of the governance structure and devolution it tells you a lot. Most Kenyans desire devolution but at what cost are they willing to go to sustain it? These are the questions that we need to ask ourselves.&rdquo;&ldquo;This is one of the things (the report) that would be considered in any review that Kenyans would desire to make in the Constitution. Whether we are over represented or not is a matter that should be subjected to the general populace,&rdquo; said the Speaker.Mr Muturi said the issue of Kenya being over represented had been highlighted by other people, who had warned that it may be difficult for Kenyans to meet the cost of sustaining the many positions created under the Constitution.National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale said it was up to Kenyans to decide on the way forward. &ldquo;Even a look at the governance structure it shows that we are bloated, it is expensive and uncalled for. I think even if we look at other countries, and I have seen the analysis by the media, our neighbours have more rational, balanced structures. You can&rsquo;t have 43 million people represented by more than 3,000 people,&rdquo; he said.Mr Duale however said the debate on possible changes to the law ought to come after the next election.&ldquo;The report is coming at the wrong time and we need to interrogate that document in 2018 when the Twelfth Parliament is in session,&rdquo; he added.However, he noted that Dr Ouko&rsquo;s team, it failed to state how wastage and corruption should be dealt with.&ldquo;The independent office that has been created is the Office of the Auditor-General. In his own report, he has not told us how we reduce public wastage and corruption.&rdquo;Deputy Minority Leader Jakoyo Midiwo said only constitutional amendment would save Kenyans from the huge burden of sustaining the many offices of representation.&ldquo;We made several mistakes when the Ligale team went round dishing out new constituencies that were not required, at times even to please some political players. Kenyans cannot afford the current political offices and certainly something has to give because we cannot continue borrowing to pay idle people,&rdquo; he said.He proposed that as Kenyans move to polls next year, a referendum be conducted to reduce the number of offices, that would take effect in the 2022 elections.
