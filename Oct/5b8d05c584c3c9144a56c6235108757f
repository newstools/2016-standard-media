The Government will require Sh129 billion to settle teachers&#39; 300 per cent salary demand, it has emerged.And the cost could rise after secondary school teachers placed additional demands as talks with the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) kicked off yesterday. Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) yesterday amended its pay proposal to include four demands that would push up the cost of implementation.Kuppet wants the teachers comprehensive medical cover to be expanded by Sh3 billion.This means the cost of medical cover will shoot up to Sh8.6 billion, up from the current Sh5.6 billion.If implemented, the lowest paid teacher will have an in-patient cover of Sh1.2 million, up from the current Sh300,000.TSC has already signed a new three-year contract with AON Kenya, which will see teachers get an in-patient cover of between Sh500,000 and Sh1.5 million.Teachers will also enjoy reviewed optical and dental cover under the new contract signed on Monday.Kuppet also wants its members to get a car grant of Sh1 million.In addition, the union proposes mortgage for all teachers and free education for at least two of their children at secondary and university levels.Kuppet Secretary General Akelo Misori said TSC allowed them to file the add-ons by close of business yesterday.&quot;They promised to table a counter-offer on October 19. After that we will form teams to discuss various aspects of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA),&quot; said Misori.This means the Kuppet meeting will come just a day after TSC meets Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) on October 18.A document prepared by Knut says the cost implication of implementing the new CBA is &quot;within reach of the Government.&quot;In a letter to Basic Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang, Knut also lists a gap of Sh18 billion for recruiting 90,000 teachers under the 2017/18 financial year.&quot;We propose TSC hires 40,000 teachers next year and clears the balance of 90,000 in the 2018/19 financial year to address the deficit,&quot; said Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion.The letter dated October 3 further says the State must find another Sh10 billion to promote some 53,000 teachers.&quot;Well remunerated teaching staff is required to boost morale. Despite heavy investment by teachers to acquire higher qualifications, a huge backlog of pending promotion cases has not been addressed since 2014,&quot; noted Mr Sossion.TSC announced last month it had promoted some 7,402 teachers to higher job groups.The biggest beneficiaries of the exercise were teachers in lower job groups and principals.&quot;The calculations we have done cater for teachers currently undertaking courses and those who already graduated and have never been considered,&quot; said Sossion.Cumulatively, the total cost of effecting the ongoing CBA talks, promotion of teachers and recruitment of more staff will come to Sh153.8 billion, says Knut.Both Knut and Kuppet want a basic salary demand of between 200 and 300 per cent.This means the highest paid secondary school teacher will take home Sh605,960 per month and the lowest paid under job group J will earn Sh73,986.For primary school teachers, the lowest paid (job group G) will take home Sh50,016 and the highest paid (job group R) earns Sh289,856 per month.Kuppet also wants teachers who have attained higher qualifications &ndash; master&#39;s degree and above &ndash; be paid postgraduate allowance at 40 per cent of the new basic salary.
