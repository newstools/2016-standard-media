PHOTO: COURTESY Opposition leaders pressed President Uhuru Kenyatta to break his six-day silence and speak out on the latest scandal to rock his administration which, at Sh5 billion, is billed the biggest to be pulled off under his watch.The President who was in Sudan yesterday left his subordinates to fight the mounting public outrage over the Sh5 billion ministry of Health scandal that has sucked in names of his closest relatives and shaken his administration only days after shoving off blame at the State House anti-corruption summit on October 18 to officials at the Judiciary, Attorney General&#39;s office, Director of Public Prosecutions, anti-graft agency and criminal intelligence. Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu convened a press conference at which he sought to poke holes on some findings of the leaked internal audit while State House operatives pushed the campaign to discredit the report online.President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s aide Dennis Itumbi dragged State House into the planning and proceedings of the conference, even giving an insight into yesterday&#39;s briefing by Dr Mailu, on his Facebook page.Itumbi dismissed the audit report as &quot;a letter asking for management response&quot;.He said yesterday&#39;s news conference by Mailu, who as a Cabinet Secretary reports directly to the President, would be about documents, vouchers and power-point presentations &quot;adding that these are facts&quot;.AUDIT QUERIESBut then, even as he waded into the audit queries at Afya House, he indicated that he was still waiting for the due process of investigation and verification to go on.Mailu, on the other hand, broke off his Sunday break to explain issues to do with the graft crisis at his ministry and even promised to appoint an external auditor to look at the audit report in question and the ministry at large.This was at a time when Kenyans are awaiting for outcome of investigators dispatched to the ministry last week.The president&#39;s own loud silence on the matter continued yesterday as it emerged the issue of corruption which has stunned Kenyans was left out of the weekly Sunday statement by State House.Yesterday&#39;s briefing avoided the subject that has gripped media reports since last Wednesday and instead dwelt on Uhuru&#39;s official visit to Sudan, today&#39;s scheduled State visit by Tanzanian President John Magufuli and some upcoming high-level meetings in Kenya.However, Deputy President William Ruto led Jubilee leaders in discrediting reports about the latest scam, which he blamed on the Opposition.Mr Ruto claimed the Opposition had resorted to linking Jubilee Government&#39;s development projects to corruption because they cannot compete on policies.He also said that Jubilee &quot;does not entertain thieves, those that have been caught have been kicked out, and those who will be caught will be arrested and prosecuted&quot;.&quot;They raised concerns over the Standard Gauge Railway, laptop project for primary schools, roads development, health equipment in major hospitals, Eurobond loan but they were not able to pin it to corruption because it was all lies,&quot; Ruto claimed at St Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in Kapyemit, Uasin Gishu.Ruto added: &quot;Now they are at it again by rushing to the media to report about the loss of billions in the Health ministry. The truth is that they are quick to make the claims because they have no plan and concrete development plans to share with Kenyans as they seek to compete with us in 2017 polls.&quot;Senate Minority Leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula asked President Kenyatta to end his silence on the Health ministry scandal and move to punish those involved in the theft.Mr Wetang&#39;ula argued it would be wrong for Uhuru to maintain silence when Kenyans were waiting to see his response to the allegations, more so because some of his relatives have been implicated.&quot;Uhuru should act as the Head of State and take action against all ministry officials and business people who were involved in the scandal,&quot; he stated.Orange Movement&#39;s national chairman John Mbadi said the president owes the country an explanation as the health scam has fallen right on his doorstep.SHIFT BLAMEHe added previously, the President had exonerated himself from graft and shifted the blame to the authorities mandated to fight graft for allegedly failing to bring the corrupt culprits to justice but in the latest case his relatives and close friends had been mentioned.&quot;The President must speak out. Failure to speak out means either he is very aware about it or he just does not care,&quot; said Mbadi.Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi also accused Jubilee leaders of being insensitive to Kenyans as the multi-billion shilling scandal at the Ministry of Health continued to unfold.He regretted that even before the theft at National Youth Service had been dealt with conclusively, another bigger scandal was taking shape at the ministry of Health.&quot;Why would somebody in his rightful senses steal money set aside for women and children?&quot; Mudavadi posed.Speaking in Navakholo yesterday during a funds drive in aide of Bushili Catholic Church, Mudavadi wondered why the Government was telling women to deliver in hospital when the money to facilitate this service was being stolen.Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama (Wiper) said: &quot;The unapologetic top leadership does not feel any remorse or embarrassment. Do not be surprised if they just come out to justify their action or worse of, even deny.&quot;Homa Bay MP Peter Kaluma claimed: &quot;The scandal has revealed deep reach of corruption in the Jubilee administration.&quot;Six Jubilee Party-allied MPs also accused the opposition of politicising the war on corruption.Speaking yesterday at Africa Inland Church (AIC) Mung&#39;ala in Machakos Town Constituency, Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti, MPs Victor Munyaka (Machakos Town), Itwiku Mbai (Masinga), Florence Kajuju (Meru County), Joe Munuve (Mwingi North) and John Wainganjo (Ol-joro-orok) said calls by the Opposition for President Uhuru to resign over alleged corruption in government were unrealistic.The legislators argued established independent constitutional institutions were capable of investigating corruption.
