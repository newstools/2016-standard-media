Any motorist who tries to bribe an officer, the said officer should make a report on a charge sheet,&quot; said NTSA Director General Francis Meja.He added: &quot;The best way to deal with corruption is to put in place systems that would make it difficult for the act to occur.&quot;To avert graft, officers will be equipped with body cameras.
