Former President Kibaki&rsquo;s Party of National Unity (PNU) has begun receiving subtle and public endorsements as a beneficial alternate for Jubilee Party in next year&rsquo;s General Elections.Current and former allies of the former president, PNU-allied politicians and political observers claim that PNU&rsquo;s place as an independent party supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election may boost voter turn-out especially in Jubilee strongholds. The dyed-in-the-wool Jubilee converts however aver that the presidential ticket is the one which will pull voters into polling stations and that candidates at the county levels, including those vying on PNU ticket, will benefit from the situation.Voter turn-out is an important variable in presidential elections especially closely-called ones. In the 2013 polls, the unprecedented voter turn-out of 85.6 per cent was largely credited with Jubilee&rsquo;s slim and contested win over CORD.In President Kenyatta&rsquo;s Central Kenya strongholds, voter turn-out was as high as 95 per cent as people took it as do-or-die affair for their candidate.&ldquo;The circumstances of 2013 were unique in the sense that people had certain imagined fears over what was going on at that moment,&quot; Nderitu Muriithi, PNU founder member said.&quot;In the current scheme of things and with change of circumstances, you need stiff competition at county levels to trigger high voter turn-out. The last thing one should think of is to kill parties much less those in Jubilee strong-holds.&quot;Mr Muriithi, a nephew to Kibaki, said it is in the best interests of top Jubilee leaders that PNU is left to thrive on its own and in accordance with the wishes of its members.He said a situation where only one JP candidate is nominated to contest will breed voter apathy to the detriment of Kenyatta.&ldquo;We are not simply saying this because we are in PNU. These are cold facts which are appreciated by every sane politician who is not looking at things with blinkers on. This is partly why only one wing of the JP machinery is fighting PNU because they are looking at elections beyond 2017. They do not appear to know that we must first win 2017,&rdquo; he added.David Murathe, Jubilee Party&rsquo;s vice-chairman and a close ally of the president is however categorical that PNU &ldquo;does not add or remove any value&rdquo; in Jubilee. The same sentiments are shared by Kiharu MP Kang&rsquo;ata Irungu.&ldquo;PNU does not matter in our calculations. As a matter of fact, the much we know is that PNU was among the parties that merged with JP in a public event witnessed by millions of Kenyans across the world. Some people have challenged the merger and the matter is awaiting arbitration,&rdquo; Mr Murathe said.&ldquo;The problem with PNU is impostors. Even people who were running mate to Musalia Mudavadi in UDF and the losers in Laikipia purport to be the party leader and director of elections respectively,&rdquo; he said in reference to Jeremiah Kioni, Mudavadi&rsquo;s running mate in 2013, and Muriithi.According to George Nyamweya, a former PNU nominated MP, Mr Kibaki&rsquo;s re-election in 2007 was helped a great deal by encouraging many PNU-allied parties to field candidates in parliamentary and civic elections.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the strategies we used to win the 2007 presidential poll. Despite the immense work Kibaki had done in his first term, and because of the nature of our political realities, we were not assured of re-election. The concept of affiliate parties helped a great deal and the disparities between the presidential vote and the parliamentary ones told it all,&rdquo; Mr Nyamweya said.He said those in JP pushing the idea that they can win the election on purely performance grounds and antagonising smaller parties supportive of their cause are living in fool&rsquo;s paradise.&ldquo;One can even go further and argue that they are inadvertently sabotaging the president. There is no other way one can explain this obsession with PNU to the point where the Registrar of Political Parties has resorted to blatant abuse of office,&rdquo; he added.Kang&rsquo;ata, formerly of TNA and now a JP zealot, scoffs at the whole idea of PNU enhancing voter turn-out. For him, the matter is plain and simple: PNU will be a liability to JP and should either fold or keep off.&ldquo;We have all sacrificed our parties and buried them for good because we wanted to form a single party which will outlive our political careers. What is so special about PNU? The voter turn-out thing is a ploy being used to hoodwink us to tolerate them but we will not,&rdquo; Mr Kang&rsquo;ata says.He asks where PNU was when TNA swept all seats in Central in 2013 elections: &ldquo;We won against their candidates. If anything, people are pulled into polling stations by the presidential ticket, not the other way round.&ldquo;We all enjoyed the goodwill of the president because he had a bigger profile than us,&rdquo; he said.But as the politicians slog it out on PNU, a close contact of Kibaki who refused to be named proffered a piece of advice to JP zealots: &ldquo;From our experience, parties such as PNU are those kind which you do not promote but which you entertain.&rdquo;Commenting on the claims that the former President had endorsed the death of PNU, the contact said such an endorsement is only possible if it were &ldquo;drawn out from him with a syringe.&rdquo;&ldquo;The sentimental value of the party especially to those tied to his era is not lost to him. It&rsquo;s a party that enjoys nostalgic support of those who witnessed the transformation of this country in a manner never witnessed before,&rdquo; he said.He said the most pragmatic view is to allow PNU to assume its own trajectory especially in offering succor to politicians who miss out in JP and the new ones trying to come up but are oppressed by established colleagues.&ldquo;Look, wherever you find a swimming pool, even in a university where everyone is a grown-up, you will always find a smaller pool by its side. That small pool takes care of a very important category of people who may not know how to swim, who are learning how to swim or who simply want to warm their legs,&rdquo; he said.
