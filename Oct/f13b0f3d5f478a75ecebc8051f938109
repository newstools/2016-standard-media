The life of Wycliffe Bett, 27, completely changed early this year after he was assaulted on his way to work by gangsters.He was hit on the neck and it affected his spinal cord, making him lose muscle function on both his upper and lower limbs.Mr Bett recalls that on the fateful day, he was on his way to work from Langata estate. Upon alighting in town at around 6am, he decided to walk to Ngara through Globe Cinema route, when he was attacked.&ldquo;I felt something hit me from behind. Although I did not lose consciousness, I could not move until a Good Samaritan arrived and took me to Kenyatta National Hospital,&rdquo; said Bett.Referral caseHe stayed at the hospital for 10 days before he was transferred to Coptic Hospital for surgery and later moved to the National Spinal Injury Referral Hospital for rehabilitation.It was a big adjustment for him to move from being completely independent to having the smallest tasks, like feeding and putting on clothes, done for him.After close to four months of physiotherapy at the hospital, Bett has regained a little independence and can use his hands. He is now working on strengthening the lower limbs.He said the healing process started when he accepted the situation.Also recovering at the same hospital is Joshua Lekayie, 24, who suffers from paraplegia &mdash; paralysis of both lower limbs &mdash; following a road accident. He was hit on his way from work and thrown on the road along Outer Ring road, before being run over by another car.Mr Lekayie was treated for several injuries, including internal bleeding, at KNH before the crack on his spinal cord was discovered and stabilised.He was also later referred to National Spinal Injury Referral Hospital for rehabilitation. He has made tremendous progress and is now ready to rejoin the society while continuing his treatment.&ldquo;I have already been discharged and I am just waiting to go back home. I will, however, be coming back for check-ups,&rdquo; said Lekayie.Currently, road accidents remain the leading cause of spinal cord injuries in the country, according to the Government.Road safetyStatistics reveal that between 400 and 1,500 individuals suffer spinal cord injuries annually, mainly caused by accidents, falls and physical attacks.Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu noted that more males suffer from the condition compared to their female counterparts.&ldquo;Studies on the injuries record that male to female ratio is at least 4:1 and sometimes higher,&rdquo; said Mailu yesterday during the World Spine Day at the National Spinal Injury Referral Hospital.In his speech read by the ministry&rsquo;s head of Curative and Rehabilitation Unit Izaq Odongo, the Cabinet secretary called on Government agencies concerned with road safety to put in place measures to curb accident-related injuries.He also called for a multi-sectoral approach in creating public awareness on spinal cord injury causes, prevention and caring for patients.National Spinal Injury Referral Hospital Spine Specialist Dennis Onsinyo noted that spinal code injuries can be classified as either severe or partial.&ldquo;Permanent disability occurs in the case of severe injury while in partial injury the cord is only partially severed, allowing the injured person to retain some functions,&rdquo; he explained.This year&rsquo;s theme: &ldquo;Straighten up and move&rdquo; was informed by the lack of adequate awareness on lifestyles that can affect one&rsquo;s spinal cord.Dr Onsinyo noted that poor postures and inactivity can contribute to the development of back pains and other spinal disorders.
