Local residents said Kenya Police Reservists (KPRs) engaged the raiders in a fierce gun battle forcing them to abandon their mission.&quot;We are worried of the raiders who even defy heavy police presence and are not scared of the DP warning to deal ruthlessly with the perpetrators,&quot; said Richard Ruto, a local resident.He said police officers were also late to arrive at the scene adding that raiders were three kilometers into the Marakwet territory.&quot;We alerted security officers in time that the raiders were planning to attack us but they did not act,&quot; he said.Area deputy county commissioner Eric Wamulevu absolved the security officers from any blame.&quot;We sent officers immediately we received the information about the attack and our officers together with the KPR managed to thwart them,&quot; said the administrator.He said patrols have been intensified in the entire Kerio Valley where over 30 people have lost their lives this year in cattle rustling related raidsWhile addressing residents on Thursday the Deputy President said the Government will with immediate effect deploy 40 Kenya Police Reservists in each of the two sub counties; Marakwet East and Tiaty.
