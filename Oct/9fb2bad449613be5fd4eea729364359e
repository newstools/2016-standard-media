Kilukumi claimed that on September 28, Mwangi through twitter falsely and maliciously posted a tweet concerning Ruto.But in a counter-claim, Mwangi said his posts were fair comment and justified.He argued the DP ought to absorb public scrutiny since he was a public officer and that he had been mentioned in matters that raised doubts about his reputation.Court papers by the former journalist contended that DP had no reputation to claim.In the reply, the activist stated that DP had been adversely mentioned in relation to corrupt dealings, among them alleged land grabbing.&ldquo;He publicly admitted he owns Weston Hotel which is built on public land and is in the flight path to Wilson airport,&rdquo; stated Mwangi.He also took on the DP over comments allegedly made in an interview alleging Mwangi was a drunkard, saying he was defamed.Mwangi said the comment by the DP also portrayed him as alcohol-dependent, one with irresponsible moralities and incompetent to hold office yet he had earned more than 20 honours from 2004 for his works.&ldquo;As a consequence of the publication of the Deputy President&rsquo;s remarks, his reputation has been seriously damaged, he has suffered distress and embarrassment,&rdquo; said Mr Imanyara.He also alleged Ruto was linked to crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Court (ICC) and had not been cleared yet.Mwangi insisted the ICC was only stopped due to witness coercion and intrusion, among other reasons, leading to his clearance.
