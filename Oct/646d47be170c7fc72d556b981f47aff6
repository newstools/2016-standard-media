Ten members of the Kisumu County Assembly and their clerk have recorded statements with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) over misuse of Sh280 million. The MCAs and the assembly clerk spent most of Wednesday at the DCI headquarters in Kisumu where they were grilled regarding the loss of money meant for the Ward Development Fund. Part of the money was to be used on development projects in all the county&rsquo;s 35 wards. Meanwhile, Chief Officer for Roads and Infrastructure Samwel Otieno yesterday clarified that he was not among the officers who recorded statements on Wednesday. &ldquo;I was not among those who recorded statements. Nobody has asked me to record a statement,&rdquo; said Mr Otieno.
