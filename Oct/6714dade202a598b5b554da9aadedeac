A section of Kitui County leaders have prevailed on CORD leader Raila Odinga to back co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka as the coalition&rsquo;s flag bearer.National Assembly Minority Leader Francis Nyenze said unlike others in the coalition, Kalonzo was untainted thus the most suited candidate to send Jubilee home.Mr Nyenze exuded confidence that Kalonzo would be CORD&rsquo;s presidential candidate in 2017. &ldquo;Take it from me, CORD&rsquo;s presidential flag bearer will be Kalonzo Musyoka and there is no turning back,&rdquo; Nyenze said.INTEGRITY TESTThe Kitui West MP noted that among all the three CORD co-principals, Kalonzo was the only one who passed the integrity test, saying the others had been adversely mentioned in graft cases.The legislator seemed to add voice to calls by a section of Kitui professionals who have urged Raila to honour an MoU he had with the Wiper leader prior to the 2013 elections.Campbell Munyambu, a Wiper member and co-ordinator of Mwingi Professionals Forum and Business Community, yesterday said the MoU stipulated that Kalonzo would support Raila in 2013 while the ODM leader would support Kalonzo in 2017 regardless of the outcome of the presidential election result.&ldquo;CORD has repeatedly said that they won the last presidential election but it was stolen. ODM has said as much, that means Kalonzo helped Raila win. Whether the election was stolen or not, that is neither here nor there. It is his (Raila&rsquo;s) turn now to support Kalonzo and there are no two ways about it,&rdquo; Mr Munyambu said.Speaking during a two-day campaign tour of Nyamira and Kisii counties, the Wiper leader said he stood a better chance of being elected president next year.
