The outgoing electoral agency commissioners have called on politicians to stop interfering with the operations of the commission.Speaking during a thanksgiving ceremony for commissioner Thomas Letangule at his Kabarak home in Nakuru County at the weekend, five Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioners led by vice chair Lilian Mahiri-Zaja said politicians should leave the incoming commission to perform its duties without interference.Others present during the ceremony were Commissioners Yusu Nzibo, Muthoni Wangai, Mohammed Alawi and Nairobi county assembly Speaker Alex ole Magelo. The commissioners said their decision to leave office next month was driven by the need to uphold peace in the country.&ldquo;Those shouting the loudest and serving in Senate or National Assembly have nothing against how the commission conducted elections but their concern is why their presidential candidate was beaten. Let me assure them that even today if the 2013 elections is repeated, the current president will still win,&rdquo; said Mr Letangule.CONDEMN COMMISSIONAccording to them, it was wrong for politicians, especially those who have been elected, to condemn the commission yet they are the ones who oversaw the 2013 elections through which they were elected.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vice chair said the electoral commission has formulated an election plan that will ensure the 2017 elections are smoothly run.&ldquo;We are leaving office next month and those who will be defeated in 2017 must accept Kenyans&rsquo; verdict and go home the way we accepted to leave office for the sake of peace and tranquility,&rdquo; said commissioner Alawi.Baringo county governor aspirant Kiprono Chelugui asked the Government to consider giving outgoing commissioners another chance to serve Kenyans in different capacities.Mr Magelo asked the Government to consider replacing lawyer Letangule with somebody from the Maasai community to represent the interests of the pastoralists in the country.
