Bar owners in Laikipia County have been slapped with a Sh 80,000 by the Laikipia county government as liquor license fee. The move has caused protests from the businessmen who have accused the government of charging them exorbitant fees. This is up from the Sh10,000 they previously paid. Through a letter addressed to the bar owners by the Laikipia county drinks and alcoholic board secretary John Kago, they will be required to pay the amount annually. The move has seen those who have not complied with the law arrested within Nyahururu, Rumuruti and Nanyuki town in the last two days. On Tuesday, the bar owners association protested against the move saying that there was a pending court case on the matter. Their chairman Sherrif Ndungu said that they have a court order directing that a status quo remains until the case is heard and determined. &quot;We have seen county officials arresting some of us despite the court order. We want them to respect the judicial process until the case is heard and determined,&quot; he said. He regretted that charging them such a huge amount was not being considerable. &quot;Many of us cannot afford such an amount and this means that we will close business. We wonder why they came up with such a figure from and there was no public participation on the matter,&quot; he said. Ndungu noted that they would petition Governor Joshua Irungu to intervene so that the fee can be reduced.
