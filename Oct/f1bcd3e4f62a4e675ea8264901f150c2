Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero can now rest easy after his nomination as CORD candidate to defend his seat was assured.Coalition co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday declared they would not field any candidate to battle it out with Dr Kidero for the Nairobi governor ticket in next year&#39;s election.&quot;Kidero, you have no challenger as long as CORD remains together... for that, prepare yourself for a second term,&quot; he said. Mr Kalonzo made the remarks on Tuesday night in the presence of his co-principals Raila Odinga and Moses Wetang&#39;ula in an event to celebrate his African Dignitary Man of The Year Award.CORD affiliate parties had agreed that they would jointly field candidates for seats in Nairobi, but would individually field candidates in other parts of the country.Part of the agreement for Nairobi include trading seats in an arrangement that would see one party produce governor and the other two producing senator and woman representative candidates. It is also a sigh of relief to Dr Kidero who had last month written a protest letter to its Orange party of plotting to rig him out in the party primaries.He had accused ODM Director of Elections Junet Mohammed of vowing that the party would deny him the ticket.The pronouncement by the former Vice President came barely a month after the county boss and his deputy Jonathan Mueke met him at his Karen home.Jubilee camp has declared they would pull all the stops to ensure they win the seat.
