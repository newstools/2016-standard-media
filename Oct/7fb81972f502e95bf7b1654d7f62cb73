A nominated MP has petitioned the National Assembly to investigate what she terms the &lsquo;illegal extension&rsquo; of a mining permit to Base Titanium Ltd.Nominated MP Zuleikha Hassan told The Standard that the licence given to the Australian company was clouded in secrecy, with no one providing satisfactory answers. &ldquo;Everyone has been shifting the goal posts concerning the matter and that is why as the people of Kwale, we have petitioned Parliament to come out with answers,&rdquo; she said.In the petition seen by The Standard, she noted that efforts to resolve the matter with the relevant Government agencies had been futile. She said the matter was not pending before any tribunal or court of law.The MP wants investigations carried out by the Departmental Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.&ldquo;The petitioner prays that the committee launches investigations into the matter and recommends the revocation of the mining licence. You should also intervene to ensure that an environmental impact assessment is conducted and ensure that the petitioners&rsquo; plight is addressed,&rdquo; read the petition.&nbsp;PRIVATE PROPERTYIt added that in the recent past, Base Titanium had erected beacons on private property with the intention of conducting mining activities which contravened Section 11(1) and (2) of the Land Act 2012, which provides that the commission shall take appropriate action to maintain public land that has endangered or endemic species of flora and fauna, critical habitats or protected areas.The Act says the commission shall identify ecologically-sensitive areas that are within public lands and demarcate or take any other justified action on those areas and act to prevent environmental degradation and climate change.It is alleged that the Mining ministry issued a further two-year licence to the company without public participation.Early this month, there were conflicting statements regarding the issuance of a Special Prospecting Licence to the company to further explore other minerals. On one hand, Base Titanium said it was given the permit while the ministry said they had not issued any licences to the company but only approved a request to map new areas for resources.&ldquo;We are waiting for them to get consent from the county government and communities around where they want to explore,&rdquo; said Mining Cabinet Secretary Dan Kazungu.
