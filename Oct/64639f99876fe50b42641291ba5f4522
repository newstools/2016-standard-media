Twelve schools have been evacuated after a lump of uranium was found in a science classroom sparking nuclear terror.The discovery was made when antinuclear campaigner Thomas Neff was giving a lecture to pupils about an old wristwatch from the 1960s with a radium dial.The numerals on the watch contain the material to help them to glow in the dark and were created when little was known about the damage caused by radiation. But as he passed a collection of rocks, minerals and fossils that were on display in the classroom, Neff&#39;s Geiger counter almost &quot;exploded&quot;.The class was evacuated and experts called in and discovered that one of the rocks was a uranium rock.It sparked a city-wide check, with 373 schools notified by education officials, and at least 11 others unwittingly had the rocks.The antinuclear campaigner had wanted to demonstrate how radioactive the watches were when he turned up at the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart School in Salzburg, the Austrian city on the border with Germany.The expert, Thomas Neff, said: &quot;I brought the old watch from the sixties which lights brightly at night because of the radiation.&quot;He said the watch had been carefully sealed so that nothing could leak out, and despite that the Geiger counter had notched up 1,200 counts per minute, 20 times the normal value.Yet as he walked close to the classroom display, Neff&#39;s Geiger counter reached over 102,000 counts per minute, sparking the evacuation.If the non-measurable alpha-radiation were to be included, the actual radiation exposure should be at least 250,000 counts per minute, according to local media.Thomas Neff said: &quot;If you had this rock the whole year in your bag, you would get around 210 millisievert exposure. The exposure to radiation from natural sources is only 2.8 millisievert in a whole year in Austria.&quot;To put this into perspective, in the US the maximum allowable yearly occupational dose is 50 millisievert, while 100 millisievert exposure per year is the lowest yearly dose linked to a likely increase in cancer risk. Yet for severe radiation poisoning, at least 2,000 millisievert would be needed.Education chiefs said that none of the schools had realised the danger of the radioactive rock that they had on display.]The radiological laboratory in Austria said: &quot;The radioactive screening and the risk assessment show a basic risk potential in Salzburg schools in case of improper storage.&quot;All of the radioactive rock samples are currently in the radiological laboratory at the University of Graz, with one exception.A fish fossil that also turned out to be radioactive can still be shown in the biology area in a state school after it was deemed to be low enough to not pose any risk.
