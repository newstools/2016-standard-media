Cedar Consulting, an advisor on transformation projects, has signed a partnership deal with Prosci, a change management firm.Cedar Consulting Director Nyawera Kibuka says: &ldquo;As Kenyan institutions respond to a more complex business and geopolitical environment, they are investing billions of shillings in change initiatives.&rdquo; But, he said entrenched attitudes and interests make it hard to realise a return on this investment. &ldquo;These can only be overcome through a deliberate and proactive approach to change management.&rdquo; Cedar Consulting has partnered with Prosci, to launch change management solutions. The deal will enable Cedar to offer tools and certification for the management of people- focused change in business and government.Prosci&rsquo;s Vice President of Global Business, Mark Dorsett says: &ldquo;Transformations that positively impact an organisation, do not happen by chance. I think our understanding of change leadership, partnered with Cedar Consulting&rsquo;s local experience, will help East African organisations improve their odds of success.&rdquo;
