Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has clarified that he has no plans of joining the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD).Mudavadi said the party&rsquo;s announcement on Friday giving a nod for a &lsquo;National Super Alliance&rsquo; was wrongly interpreted to show that he has agreed to &lsquo;shake hands&rsquo; with CORD principal Raila Odinga.He said the reports have elicited mixed reactions among his supporters from the Western stronghold who are already backing his 2017 presidential bid. He stated that the idea behind the said super alliance is much bigger than just political parties.&ldquo;When we talk of a super alliance who said it only involves political parties? We might as well bring on board churches, business society, unions, and teachers.&quot;What we need are people with like minds who can change this country,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.Mudavadi was speaking during the unveiling of Nairobi Mulembe Teachers Association in Nairobi.The event was graced by Members of Parliament from his Western backyard including Yusuf Chanzu (Vihiga), Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), Alfred Sambu (Webuye East) and Alfred Agoi (Sabatia).The ANC party leader said the philosophy behind the alliance is to &lsquo;crystallise&rsquo; a vehicle that will manage to drive Jubilee Party out of power.On Friday, the party&rsquo;s National Executive Council meeting in Machakos agreed to the formation of an alliance.MPs allied to the party yesterday said that a super alliance was the way to go but they still maintained that Mudavadi should be on the ballot in August 2017.&ldquo;Western people have been so generous (with votes) for so long. Maybe our democracy is over-developed.&quot;This time let that generosity be directed at ANC and we can have our own in power,&quot; Bunyasi said.Sabatia MP Agoi said the Western community has been sidelined for long and it is a high time the Luhya community got a new strategy.
