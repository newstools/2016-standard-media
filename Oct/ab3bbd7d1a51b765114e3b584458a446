Unilever Kenya has re-launched Royco Mchuzi Mix, to meet increased demand for natural food flavorings. &nbsp;The new Royco Mchuzi mix is made up of natural, sundried herbs and spices, that enhance the flavor and aroma of food and gives it a deeper, richer color. &nbsp;The natural ingredients include Coriander, Garlic, Fennel, Methee, Cumin, Turmeric and Paprika.&nbsp; These ingredients are preserved through sun drying, to ensure they retain their original flavor. &nbsp; Speaking in Nairobi, Unilever Kenya Marketing Director, Agnes Kitololo said tapping Africa&rsquo;s consumer markets require companies to cater to the needs of a more confident, ambitious and knowledgeable consumer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Today, our insights show that consumers are more conscious of healthy eating, than past generations. They are also more invested in finding food adventures; food that delivers a new flavor or new take on healthy indulgences,&rdquo; noted Ms Kitololo.&nbsp;She added: &ldquo;The new Royco Mchuzi Mix is responding to this; it is packed with natural ingredients that will give your food rich flavor, aroma and a deeper, richer color. It also offers consumers more convenience. They do not have to go shopping for a variety of ingredients if the spices can be found packed in one, which is still as healthy as the natural ingredients,&rdquo; said Ms Kitololo.According to the 2016 Food Trends Report by international research firm Global Food Forum, foods that deliver on both health and convenience will proliferate and gain wider distribution as consumers look for easy ways to incorporate more &lsquo;good-for-you&rsquo; products into their lives.
