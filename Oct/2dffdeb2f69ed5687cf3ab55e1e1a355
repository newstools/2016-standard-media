CORD co-principal Moses Wetang&#39;ula has said the Opposition is not in a hurry to name its presidential flag bearer.Mr Wetang&#39;ula said in the run-up to the 2002 general election, CORD leader Raila Odinga endorsed retired President Mwai Kibaki as Narc&#39;s joint presidential candidate two months to the elections. Kibaki later faced off with Kanu&#39;s Uhuru Kenyatta.&quot;You all saw what happened as Kibaki was elected Kenya&#39;s third President with an overwhelming majority,&quot; Wetang&#39;ula told worshippers during a church service at the AIC Kongowea Church in Mombasa yesterday.There have been intensified calls for CORD to name its flag bearer, with the Wiper party giving a December 2016 ultimatum.Wiper has demanded the naming of the coalition&#39;s presidential candidate by Christmas Day while the Orange party favours April or May next year.COMING TOGETHERWetang&#39;ula said the coming together of the CORD principals - himself, Raila and Kalonzo Musyoka - was not by default.&quot;We are steadfast together simply because we know that the majority of Kenyans want change,&quot; he said.The Bungoma senator was accompanied by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, Nyali&#39;s Hezron Awiti, who is eyeing the Mombasa governor&#39;s seat, and Ford-Kenya politician Yasin Bajaber.&quot;I am keen on becoming your president. Kenya is never a dynasty where the top seat can be passed from one generation to the next,&quot; said the Ford-Kenya leader.He scoffed at the Jubilee administration for allegedly perpetuating corruption and called on Kenyans to vote the ruling party out in 2017.Mr Awiti said if elected Mombasa governor, he would strive to ensure that all people lived in harmony irrespective of their backgrounds.He chided the Mombasa County leadership for allegedly turning a blind eye on local artists at the expense of foreign ones.Mr Wamalwa urged religious leaders to pray for peace in the country. He equated the CORD principals to the three cooking stones that are important to the success of the cooking process.
