&nbsp;Reports that some of the prisoners released after President Uhuru Kenyatta exercised the Constitutional Power of Mercy on Mashujaa Day have run afoul of the law shines the light on the need for and the criteria used to receive clemency. One was allegedly caught by worshippers stealing church offering during a Sunday service; yet another was caught with a stolen sheep and later found in possession of narcotics.Cases of recidivism are not unique to Kenya&rsquo;s justice system. And so although the two are a small number against the 7,000 who received clemency, their acts, nonetheless, raise pertinent questions. Had they really changed their ways given the speed at which they were caught stealing? Were they ready for life outside the prisons?After all, prisons are supposed to be correctional facilities.What are some of the factors considered before one is given clemency? And are prisons centres of reforms for lawbreakers or do they entrench vices? And is there a thorough check done on those to be released?Unless the authorities can provide answers to these questions, instances where pardoned criminals go back to crime almost immediately make a mockery of a humane gesture.
