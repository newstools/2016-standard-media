As an inaugural offer we are offering the Tele Consultation with Consultants from Columbia Asia Hospitals at a discounted fee of Sh 3, 000&rdquo;, Sumit added.The new facility plans to leverage its international presence and technology to provide quality healthcare and therefore reduce the number of Kenyans seeking these services abroad.
