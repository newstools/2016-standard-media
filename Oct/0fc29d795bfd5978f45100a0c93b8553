Raila&rsquo;s party expels 8 &lsquo;rebel&rsquo; MPs, top organ to ratify decisionThe ODM top organ meets today to ratify expulsion of eight governors and MPs deemed to have defected to Jubilee Party.National Executive Council (NEC) yesterday met and adopted a report by its disciplinary committee to de-register eight out of the 13 rebel leaders. The meeting was also attended by party leader Raila Odinga. Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Kisii County deputy governor Joash Maangi and Kwale Woman Representative Zainab Chidzuga have been axed from the party.Others shown the door are MPs Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro (Kilifi North), Mustafa Idd (Kilifi South), Steven Kariuki(Mathare), James Rege (Karachuonyo) and Samuel Arama (Nakuru West). The move may lead to by-elections ahead of the next year&#39;s General Election.ODM has, however, pardoned Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani, Sirisia MP John Waluke, Mpuri Aburi of Tigania East, Igembe Central&#39;s Cyprian Kubai and nominated MP Isaac Mwaura.The party&#39;s National Governing Council (NGC) meets today and is expected to ratify the report for further actions that include writing to the Register of Political Parties to remove the affected members from its register.Should there be no court contest, then the seats would be declared vacant by Speaker of the National Assembly.&quot;The report by the ODM disciplinary committee investigating the leaders who have publicly defected to other political parties presented by the chairman, Fred Athuok, recommended the expulsion from the party of affected members. The report was unanimously adopted by the NEC,&quot; said ODM Secretary General Agnes Zani.&quot;The report will be forwarded to the National Governing Council (NGC) tomorrow (today) for ratification,&quot; she added.On the General Election, the party has made fresh demands over the procurement of electoral equipment, listing four firms to be contracted in the process.Party chairman, John Mbadi, said they would not accept the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to engage questionable firms in buying electoral equipment.The party claimed there was an attempt by the ruling Jubilee coalition to arm-twist IEBC to water down some of the electoral reforms proposed by the joint parliamentary team.&quot;There are reputable companies out there that have been successful. These companies include Everyone Counts Incorporated (US elections), Robis Elections Company (US elections), Biolink (Nigeria elections) and Avante (Tanzania elections). The IEBC can lease the equipment from these companies,&quot; said the party in a statement.ODM has also crafted its nomination rules and timelines. In part of its strategy for the August 8, 2017, the party has zoned the country for purposes of its primaries.The country has been split into zones A, B and C. Zone B is the party&#39;s stronghold and where it would carry out rigorous primaries.ODM has in the past experienced chaos in its stronghold of Nyanza, that in some instances resulted into voter apathy.&quot;We will carry free and fair nominations. We will ensure a repeat in the event that results are contested,&quot; said Raila in a previous briefing.Areas under Zone B are Kisumu, Migori, Homa Bay, Siaya and Kakamega.Other places captured under this category are Vihiga, Bungoma, Busia, Kisii, Mombasa, Nyamira, Kwale, Turkana, Trans Nzoia, Tana River, Samburu, Narok and Kajiado.In this zone, primaries will be held about six months to the elections to give room for repeat. This means the areas will carry primaries in February.
