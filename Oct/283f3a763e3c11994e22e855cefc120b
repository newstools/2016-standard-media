ODM leaders have embarked on massive voter mobilisation and cash reward scheme.In the scheme, wa ward with the highest number of registered party members will be rewarded with Sh1 million. And to set the pace, Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma yesterday donated Sh1 million to be given to the best ODM ward office with highest number of registered voters.The cheque was presented to Mombasa governor and ODM deputy party leader, Hassan Joho, at the Christ is the Answer Ministries in Kisumu town.Mr Ranguma also stole the ODM roadshow when he emerged from the county headquarters with close to 30 Prados branded with ODM logo and portrait of party leader, Raila Odinga, in tow.Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, Migori&rsquo;s Okoth Obado and Siaya&rsquo;s Cornel Rasanga promised to follow suit as they promised to mount vigorous ODM campaigns in their electoral turfs.&ldquo;We want our people to register in big numbers for elections come 2017 so that we can realise the much hyped dream of CORD leader Raila Odinga becoming President,&rdquo; said Ranguma.This comes amid revelation that over 60,000 ID cards have not been collected from various electoral registration bureaus across Nyanza.Mr Joho challenged the leaders to appeal to eligible voters to register.He also disclosed that they had rolled out similar programmes in the Coastal region, which will be effected before the end of the year.With the 2017 elections beckoning, the ODM leaders appeared to be serious this time round with voter registration as they seek to realise geometric progression of their numbers.Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga, his Ugunja counterpart Opiyo Wandayi and Kisumu Woman Representative Rose Nyamunga told the ODM delegates to ensure their people register in large numbers.&ldquo;Unless we register in big numbers, we will face stiff competition,&rdquo; said Mr Anyanga.ODM Secretary General Agnes Zani challenged the party stalwarts especially the youth to go full throttle, mobilise their eligible peers with no IDs to get them and register for elections.&ldquo;We want as many people as possible to register for elections so that we can combine our strength to push the Jubilee regime out of power,&rdquo; argued Dr Zani.Given that in politics numbers count, the ODM fraternity have taken a &lsquo;secret oath&rsquo; with all serving leaders and aspirants to have their efforts more on voter registration in the next three months.Joho told the delegates to remain steadfast in ODM and avoid petty leadership squabbles.The governors promised to help mobilise party supporters to register as voters.
