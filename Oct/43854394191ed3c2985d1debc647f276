Governor Salim Mvurya has asked county residents to consider aspirants&#39; development record and not to vote on party lines. Mr Mvurya, who recently ditched the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) for Jubilee Party said political parties are not responsible for development. &quot;Let me caution you not to be swayed by political parties because parties do not work. The person who will work for you is Mvurya or my deputy (Fatuma) Achani,&quot; said the governor. Mr Mvurya was speaking during the opening of Kwale Women in Leadership Network seminar at Forest Lodge in Diani, which was also attended by Senate majority chief whip Beatrice Elachi, and deputy majority leader at the National Assembly, Naomi Shaban. Mvurya said before he ditched ODM, he had been insulted by the party leaders who had sworn not to give him the party nomination for next year&#39;s general election. &quot;So, we decided as leaders to make other choices,&quot; he said.
