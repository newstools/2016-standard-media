Governors have demanded thorough investigations into reports that Sh5 billion, including free maternity cash meant for counties, has been lost at the Ministry of Health.The Council of Governors (CoG) called for speedy investigations to unearth those behind the scandal and swift action taken against culprits.Chairman of CoG Peter Munya said the theft revealed by a leaked internal audit report confirmed their fears that the ailing state of the health sector was being orchestrated by the national government. Mr Munya was speaking in Kisumu after handing over the devolution torch to Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma. Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and ODM Chairman John Mbadi were present.The torch is a symbol of the achievements of devolution over the past three and a half years. It will be in Kisumu until tomorrow before moving to Kakamega.Unreasonable sharingMunya said governors have been complaining of unreasonable sharing of resources between the two levels of government, especially in the Health ministry where the lion&#39;s share of the budget was being retained yet the docket had largely been devolved.&quot;We have been complaining that there is no justification why the national ministry should be allocated large sums of money,&quot; he said.Munya said governors were saddened by the reports of the theft at a time when the counties have been grappling with health challenges due to inadequate funds.&quot;The national ministry only runs four hospitals, yet they are given half the allocation. For what?&quot; he posed.He said first signs that things were amiss at Afya House was when free maternal healthcare ran into challenges despite the Treasury proclamations that they had disbursed funds.Another indicator, he said, was when hospitals in the country ran into vaccine shortage.Maternal health&quot;I remember when we complained that money meant for maternal health was not reaching us and when we followed up with the Treasury, we were told that enough money had been released to compensate counties. Now we know why the money was not reaching us,&quot; he said.He added that their complaints on how funds meant for purchase of vaccines was being handled were also confirmed by recent demands by donors, who claimed the money was being misappropriated.He said retention of the large allocations at Afya House created loopholes for embezzlement.&quot;If you give somebody Sh45 billion and he has no health he is running, obviously people come up with innovative ways of trying to finish that budget,&quot; he said.&quot;We raised concerns that unfair sharing of resources left that money sitting where it had no use, and you have been seeing now people who are not public-willed find opportunities to misuse them.&quot;Governors are now demanding a review of how funds, especially those meant for health, are shared between the two levels of government.&quot;In the next budget, we will be demanding that more money goes to the counties because that is where health programmes are run. We have drugs to buy and doctors to pay,&quot; he said.
