&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition leaders Musalia Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka have separately spelt out terms for a super alliance to dislodge Jubilee from power in next year&rsquo;s elections. Mudavadi told CORD to resolve internal feuds to prepare for the National Super Alliance (NASA), a broader coalition that he said should not be ethnic- based but one that also incorporates groups like Cotu, religious and business outfits that feel the country is not being governed properly.Kalonzo said CORD affiliate parties should not merge, arguing that the Opposition would win more seats if individual parties fielded candidates.He challenged ODM leader Raila Odinga to back him for CORD&rsquo;s presidential ticket.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka&nbsp;warned the Opposition against dissolving their political parties.Speaking in Nyamira County yesterday, Kalonzo also asked CORD leader Raila Odinga to back him for the coalition&rsquo;s presidential ticket, saying he had sacrificed a lot for him.The former VP said allowing parties affiliated to the coalition to field candidates would improve the Opposition&rsquo;s chances of garnering more seats and votes.According to Kalonzo, merging parties would not be healthy especially when it came to seats that would determine major decisions in the country&rsquo;s two legislative assemblies.DANGEROUS SITUATIONHe hinted that Jubilee Party was planning how to have what he called &lsquo;tyranny of numbers&rsquo; in the National Assembly and Senate, a situation he said would be dangerous for the country if the Opposition dissolved parties to form mergers.&ldquo;Jubilee leaders are very cunning. They want to have tyranny of numbers to change the Constitution to suit their selfish political interests, something which is very dangerous for us as a country,&rdquo; Kalonzo said.He said he had sacrificed twice to support Raila&rsquo;s bid for the presidency and it was, therefore, high time Raila reciprocated by supporting his own candidature.He said those who were calling him a political coward because of supporting others would be surprised when he ascended to the presidency.&ldquo;It is payback time. I should also be supported as the coalition&rsquo;s presidential flag bearer,&rdquo; he said.Kalonzo said ODM, Wiper and Ford Kenya parties would go to the elections as individual political parties under the CORD umbrella.Addressing a series of political rallies in Nyamira, he said the Opposition would not make the mistake of allowing their parties to be swallowed up as had happened with Jubilee affiliate parties.He urged the public to remain united in rejecting the Jubilee leadership, which he accused of corruption, dishonesty and tribalism.&ldquo;I and my co-principals Raila Odinga (ODM) and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) are set to save the country from mismanagement, which has been perpetrated by the Jubilee government,&rdquo; he said.He asked youths over the age of 18 to get national identity cards and register as voters so that the Opposition could have a chance of defeating the Jubilee government.He reminded Kenyans that most of the projects begun by Jubilee were being used to siphon public funds, citing the Laptop for Schools project, which he said had not been implemented as promised.Kalonzo was accompanied by Borabu MP Ben Momanyi, nominated Senator Judith Achieng and West Mugirango MP Steve Mogaka.
