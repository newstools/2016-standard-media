Crossing River Lwakhakha is not for the faint-hearted.The river, which serves as the boundary between Kenya and Uganda, is a death-trap for residents of Chepkube village in Mt Elgon.With its waters running silent but very deep, the river is a source of sustenance as it offers fish to the community yet also seems to &lsquo;fish&rsquo; for people. The river has so far claimed 100 lives majority of whom are men who, caught up in a search for leisure across the river, end up crossing back while intoxicated.According to 90-year-old Zephaniah Wenjekhele, Mututho laws that bar Kenyans from drinking during working hours is what drives some men across the border to take their favourite tipple.&ldquo;These men end up coming back when they are drunk and late in the night. They are not able to manouever their way and end up falling into the river, more so when it rains and the river bursts its banks,&rdquo; Mzee Wenjekhele explained.But not everyone drowns coming from leisurely activities.Evelyne Nanjala 52, lost her husband to the river after he attempted to cross it when it was in full flood state. Her husband Jackson Nyongesa had crossed over to Uganda to sell coffee and was swept away by the raging waters. The family only discovered what happened after he did not come back home the following morning.&ldquo;We camped at the river for several days and were eventually able to retrieve his body. At the time, we did not have a bridge but two months ago, residents came together and made a makeshift bridge. We however, need our leaders to intervene and put an end to our misery,&rdquo; she said.Irene Egesa, is also a victim of the river saying she suspects her husband drowned in the river over 10 years ago but they are yet to recover his body.&ldquo;The river has claimed a lot of lives and brought endless tears to families. When a loved one crosses over to the other side, one cannot be at peace until they are safely back home - so many make the trip but do not return,&rdquo; she said.Due to its deep waters, River Lwakhakha is also a &lsquo;favourite&rsquo; for those out to end their lives; those who opt to leap into the raging waters when unable to cope with the rigours of life.
