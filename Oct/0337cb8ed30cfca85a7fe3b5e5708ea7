The long awaited teacher&#39;s salary increase talks kicked off in Naivasha with all parties involved exuding confidence that they would hit a deal.Officials from Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) and Teachers Service Commission (TSC) Monday converged at Sawela Lodge in Naivasha where the talks are going on.A source, however, said that the talks could take longer than expected with each party digging deep on their demands. The source termed the first day as slow with each of the represented parties briefing each other on their demands and timelines.&quot;KNUT is demanding a 300 percent salary rise and this is not attainable under the current financial status and this could delay the talks,&quot; said the source.The source added that the government had placed its offer on the table and both parties were discussing it.&quot;KNUT claims that the percentage offered by the government is too little and want it increased and this is part of the talks,&quot; said the source.The source added that the way ahead would be known on Tuesday when the parties are expected to table all their demands.&quot;The TSC and KNUT have a team of negotiators who are currently undergoing through the demands that have been tabled and offered from all the sides,&quot; added the source.The media was however locked out of the meeting and both parties were tightlipped over the negotiations progress.Efforts to get comment from KNUT Secretary General Wilson Sossion failed after he refused to address the media saying that they had not been invited.&quot;We had not invited the press for this meeting and we have nothing to say as of now,&quot; said Sossion before walking away.For the last couple of weeks, the teachers unions have engaged the government in negotiations over an increase in their salaries.KNUT is demanding an increase of 300 percent while their counterparts from the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) are seeking a rise of 200 percent.The unions are also demanding an increase in the allowances for their members as part of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA).
