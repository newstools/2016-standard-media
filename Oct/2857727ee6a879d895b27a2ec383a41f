Indian technology blogger Varun Krishnan was BANNED from Facebook after he shared a picture of a cat in a business suit.According to Krishnan, his Facebook account was instantly deactivated after he shared the photo with a friend. &quot;It might sound stupid but this just happened to me,&quot; Krishnan told Mashable India. &quot;I was chatting with friends, got one cat image on WhatsApp, it was so cute that I sent it to a friend.&quot; But when Facebook Messenger app immediately asked Krishnan to re-enter his credentials, he knew something was amiss.&quot;Before I realized, my devices were getting logged off. Even on PC, Messenger notified me that my Facebook account has been disabled,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;My photos, my Facebook Ads account (Varun runs FoneArena, a tech blog), they wiped my presence off Facebook in a matter of seconds for a cat photo.&quot;Facebook has reinstated Krishnan&rsquo;s account, and apologized for the incident.&nbsp;&ldquo;Our team found this was a mistake &amp; have restored your account. We&rsquo;re sorry for the trouble this caused you,&rdquo; Facebook Security Communications team told FoneArena in a statement.
