The ability of local insurance firms to absorb a Sh20 billion surge in business has been questioned. Manufacturers warn that industry regulations set to take effect in three months will disrupt import and export trade.National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich directed in June, during the presentation of the budget statement, the implementation of section 20 of the Insurance Act which compels importers to buy policy from local players. The directive is expected to push marine cargo insurance premiums handled by Kenyan underwriters from Sh2.9 billion last year to over Sh20 billion. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) however questions the administrative and financial capacity of local insurers to absorb the industry needs on maritime insurance.&ldquo;There is need for more consultative dialogue with manufacturers in the industry to ensure that the provisions do not deter trade within the country especially in the export and import of goods in and out of the country,&rdquo; KAM said in a memo.GLOBAL PARTNERSThe manufacturers&rsquo; lobby argues local firms lack the capacity in terms of capital and scope to cover terrorism and piracy, automated provision of marine insurance services that may impede efficiency, as well as ensuring adherence to regional and international legal instruments on free trade.They say the implementation has been rushed before configuring insurance services to Kenya National Single Window System and the Kenya Revenue Authority online portals facilitating trade. They also point out that there are no regulatory systems in place to ensure premiums and price controls as well as timely settlements of claims.&ldquo;There is need to review the provisions of the Act with a view to review and provide solution that is not restrictive to businesses who are trading internationally on bulk products,&rdquo; KAM said.Insurance industry players are however upbeat about the law, banking on the windfall to deliver a breakthrough for growing insurance business given that penetration in Kenya has remained at 3 per cent of GDP for years. The insurance firms say they have the options of linking up with their global partners or forming horizontal syndicates to insure expensive claims.Financial Services group UAP Old Mutual say they will refocus their specialty package to cash in on the new provision with the capacity to underwrite up to Sh25 billion ($250 million) sum insured in any one risk location.Mr Mwangi said the new requirement is a boon for the local industry coming at a time when importation of high-worth equipment and raw materials is expected to increase as a result of the massive infrastructure projects currently underway in the East and Central African region.
