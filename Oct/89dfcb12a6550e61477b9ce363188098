Since hitting an all-time low of 3.30 shillings on Sept. 20, shares have climbed 60 percent.&quot;We are having a lot of retail guys coming in,&quot; said Daniel Kuyoh of Alpha Africa Asset Managers, adding the decision to appoint Michael Joseph as the new chairman had raised hopes for more changes and improved management of the recovery.
