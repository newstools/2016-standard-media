Wrangles surrounding the establishment of the first ever public university in Baringo have taken a new twist, weeks after Deputy President William Ruto proposed another venue.Mr Ruto said the Government&#39;s decision was that Baringo Technical Institute would be converted into a university then relocated, which has angered local residents. On Monday, the DP met 30 MCAs together with all MPs from the county and Governor Ben Cheboi at his Karen home where he is reported to have told them to ensure that university was located at the technical institute.And yesterday, hundreds of residents from Seretunin trekked several kilometres to Governor Cheboi&#39;s office to register their displeasure with the way the issue had been politicised.Led by Francis Mutai, they said a task force composed of Baringo Central professionals to look into the most suitable location for the university.They said the team had settled on Moi Teachers Training College, and the report had been handed to the governor to send to the national government.&quot;The task force presented its findings at the Kenya School of Government, and participants agreed and handed them to the governor who said he supported the idea,&quot; read the signed petition to the governor.They said Baringo Central MP Sammy Mwaita had visited&nbsp;Seretunin to ascertain the existing infrastructure and promised the locals that he would support the idea.Apart from the two sites, Baringo South residents have offered more than 1,000 acres in Chemeron to the university. The land is currently being used by Egerton University for research.
