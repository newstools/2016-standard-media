Nairobi: An activist has moved to court seeking orders compelling the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to investigate and prosecute activist Boniface Mwangi over alleged hate speech and breach of peace.Victor Yegon also wants Mwangi stopped from further publishing inciteful comments on his social media pages.Through his lawyer Ham Kiplagat, Yegon says that Mwangi has been using his Social Media platform to fan ethnic violence and incite the public contrary to the National Cohesion and Integration Act. He says that during protests that followed the murder of lawyer Willy Kimani and two others, Mwangi maliciously poured a red substance on Police Spokesman Charles Owino, an act which is he said is punishable in law for breach of public peace.He says Mwangi&#39;s conduct should not go unpunished.&ldquo;The said conduct by Boniface Mwangi is prima facie evidence that the offense of hate speech and public peace has arisen and should not be left without legal consequence,&rdquo; he said.
