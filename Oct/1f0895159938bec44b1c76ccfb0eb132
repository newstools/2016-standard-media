(Photo: Moses Omusula/Standard) The US Embassy in Nairobi remains closed today, a day after a man was shot dead outside the premises for stabbing a police officer. &ldquo;The embassy will be closed to the public on October 28. While routine consular services have been cancelled, emergency consular services for the US citizens continue to be available,&rdquo; said the Embassy in a statement posted on its website. The Embassy said none of its personnel were involved and no US citizens are known to have been affected by the incident. Thursday, the man, claimed to be in his early 20s, had run directly at the officer with a knife in hand and without engaging the policeman, went for his head. But the policeman acted swiftly and blocked the weapon that was aimed at his head, in the process sustaining injuries, before he shot the assailant dead.
