The country has an abundance of natural resource wealth that has attracted investor interest in recent years.The discovery of oil reserves, as well as the roll-out of large-scale mining projects, has proven the potential for growth in the extractives sector.Government data estimates that extractives contribute just 1 per cent of GDP, and account for under 2 per cent of total exports. Yet, the sector is thought to have the potential to provide 10 per cent of GDP, and create thousands of jobs, which would generate even more revenue.EFFECTIVE MONITORINGBut one of the hurdles in the way of the sector catalysing this wave of economic growth is a lack of local expertise.And this is where a global management consulting firm has come in. Accelerate to Excellence (A2E) has set up a first-of-its-kind training facility for professionals in the mining and oil gas sector.The firm is affiliated with the Australia Africa Energy and Minerals Institute (AAEMI), and has built a reputation for itself by playing a key advisory role for governments and corporations.A2E, which will train local professionals and Government employees involved in extractives, launched its first programme last week, training officers from the Turkana County government and Public Procurement Oversight Authority (PPOA).&ldquo;We are concerned about revenue leakages in the sector because Kenya does not have the capacity to monitor what foreign companies involved in the mining and oil sector are doing,&rdquo; said Rosemary Gituma, a member of the Public Procurement Administrative Board.&ldquo;Such courses will help equip locals with the capacity to effectively monitor these activities, and plug leakages.&rdquo;Ms Gituma, who attended the training that was held in Nairobi, said the presence of the A2E in Kenya would save companies and the Government hundreds of millions of shillings. This includes the funds that would have been used to send personnel to more advanced countries to learn the critical skills required to sustain the emerging extractives sector.Adam Bick, an executive trainer on finance and accounting in the resources industry at AAEMI, said participants at the training learnt, among other things, accounting for commodity sales, timing of revenue recognition and matching of costs.&ldquo;Once people realise the scope and significance of these courses and what they could mean, not just for the trainees but for the entire oil, gas and mining industry, I believe it could become a national model,&rdquo; said Mr Bick.Accountability purposesGituma added that there has been a sense of helplessness across Government agencies that have been tasked with monitoring and regulating the sector.She said a lack of expertise has forced State agencies to rely on data produced by the foreign firms in the sector.&ldquo;When they produce data, we should also be able to produce ours independently for accountability purposes,&rdquo; Gituma said.&ldquo;These courses should not only concentrate on executives, but should also be devolved to cover operators, who are our actual representatives on the ground.&rdquo;Kenya is expected to start oil production from Turkana&rsquo;s Lokichar basin next year. An Oxfam report projects the country could earn Sh280 billion annually from this area alone if oil exports begin by 2020.bizbeat@standardmedia.co.ke
