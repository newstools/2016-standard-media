With more than half of the population being under the age of 20, Africa has the world&rsquo;s most youthful population and will have the world&rsquo;s largest workforce by 2025. Continued economic growth will ultimately depend on Africa&rsquo;s ability to harness the power of this human capital through investments in skills development.One exciting investment made by General Electric Africa is in skills training and human capital in GE Garages. This programme is providing upcoming engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs with access to state-of-the-art technology and information. In so doing, GE fostering interest in invention, innovation and advanced manufacturing. Our first GE Garage was launched in Lagos, Nigeria.&ldquo;Since taking the helm of GE Africa in 2011 and living in Nairobi, Kenya, I have been fortunate to work with organizations and individuals that are making Africa one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,&rdquo; said GE Africa CEO Jay Ireland. &ldquo;Africa is enjoying tremendous growth across a wide-range of sectors, which is having a profound impact on the societies, industries and quality of life that make this such a rich continent.&rdquo; The three-week event is a precursor to a longer term programme in collaboration with other partners focusing on skills training in Power Generation services, and eventually expanding to other sectors. By enhancing technology access to an already skilled workforce, GE Africa is confident it will increase human capital and drive entrepreneurship in the region.There is no better time to be doing business in Africa, and GE&rsquo;s contribution is of mutual benefit, growth and prosperity.
