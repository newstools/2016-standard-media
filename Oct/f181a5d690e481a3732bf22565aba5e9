The Parliamentary Committee on Lands has stepped in to resolve a dispute pitting a farmer and a land buying company. The Committee has summoned the Naivasha farmer in a dispute with over 1,700 members of the Nanga Kihoto land buying company. The committee also promised to resolve the dispute revolving around the 1,442 acres in Naivasha within 30-days. Speaking after a fact finding mission in Naivasha yesterday, the committee&#39;s acting chairman Paul Otuoma said the team will study documents presented to them by the feuding parties. The leadership tussle was tabled before Parliament by Muranga Woman Representative, Sabina Chege. Majority of the shareholders hail from her Gatanga backyard. &quot;We have listened to the grievances by the two parties and we will issue a report after 30-days so that this dispute can come to an end,&quot; said Otuoma. In her petition, Ms Chege, on behalf of the shareholders of Nanga Kihoto, urged the committee to probe attempted irregular transfer of land and fraudulent funds withdrawal from the company&#39;s accounts. &quot;Efforts to hold subsequent Annual General Meetings (AGM) over the years to deliberate on the various matters, including sub division of the parcels of land had been futile,&quot; said Chege, in her petition. She accused a former director of fraudulently withdrawing a sum of Sh495,000 from the company&#39;s bank accounts. Ms Chege called on the committee to put a caveat on the land until an AGM is held to resolve outstanding issues.
