He tightly held a brown envelope in his right hand as his fellow inmates from inside prison cells peeped in awe to catch a glimpse of what was happening. Koigi Mukia, 29, who spent five years behind bars in Nairobi West Prison, was now a free man. Muika, who was jailed on forgery charges, said his trust in God made him endure life in prison. He is among 176 prisoners who were released from Nairobi West Prison following a presidential pardon. &quot;I did not believe it when I was informed about my release. I will believe it when I get out of the prison&#39;s main gate. I had four days left to finish my term here but my prayer to God was to leave earlier,&quot; he said shortly before his release. He recalled vividly the events which landed him in prison: &quot;I was a clerk at a primary school in Mwingi where I was accused of forging a cheque. Life took an unexpected twist when I was convicted with forgery and sent to serve a five-year term in prison. I prayed God because life in prison is not a walk in the park.&quot; READ MORE 7,000 prisoners freed to create room for corrupt individuals Time for genuine action in war on graft and uniting country Half a million Nairobi residents to own county houses by 2017, says Kidero Before he was sentenced, Mukia had begun plans to marry his sweetheart. &nbsp;&quot;I was planning to marry when I was arrested.
