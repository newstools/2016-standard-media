President Uhuru Kenyatta addressing the nation during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Machakos.&nbsp;Machakos, the venue of this year&#39;s Mashujaa Day celebrations and once Kenya&#39;s capital city, was established by the British Government as their first administrative capital.In 1887, officers of Imperial British East African Company, which handed over the country to Britain after it went bankrupt, operated from the town as had been foretold by Kamba prophetess, Syokimau, who said they would come riding inside the bowels of birds and speaking in their language. Machakos was established 10 years before Nairobi, but it failed to become the centre and the heartbeat of the nation by 16 kilometres.The colonialists moved the capital to Nairobi in 1899 because Machakos was by-passed by the Uganda railway, which was under construction.However, a building that once housed the administrators still remains standing in the town, although it is dilapidated.The county was named after Masaku wa Munyati, a Kamba chief who arrived in the area in 1816 from the area around Sultan Hamud.A first-time visitor will travel at least 60 kilometres South of Nairobi, to the town.However, some areas that are associated with Nairobi, such as Athi River, Mlolongo and Syokimau are administratively under the Governor Alfred Mutua-led county.On the eastern side of the town, you find Iveti Hills, the Women&#39; Hill and Kiima Kimwe, stretching to the North and as the sun bounces its rays on its top, the covering appears to touch the blue skies.Come evening, the hills cast shadows on the plains at the margins of the town.Housed missionariesThe county also housed early Christian missionaries, among them Peter Cameron Scott, who founded Africa Inland Mission (today&#39;s Africa Inland Church).Scott fell ill and died on December 1896 of malaria, which was complicated by blackwater fever, a tragedy that was believed to have struck from the open skies.The death of the missionary brought about a theory of why foreigners ran away from the place; due to mosquitoes and perceived witchcraft.Modern-day Machakos is a business hub that hosts several institutions.
