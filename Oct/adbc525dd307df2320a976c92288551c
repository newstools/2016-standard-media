A&nbsp;report&nbsp;by the Nakuru County Assembly&nbsp;says&nbsp;most ECDE classrooms initiated by the county government are incomplete and some are substandard.The&nbsp;report&nbsp;by the Sectoral Committee on County Roads, Transport and Public Works on financial year 2014/15&nbsp;report&nbsp;states that the committee undertook site visits to various public work projects, with a target on incomplete and shoddy roads and health and ECDE projects implemented by the Public Works department. According to Controller of Budget, the county allocated Sh158 million for building ECDE centres in financial years 2013/14 and 2014/2015.In Kabatiki ward, nursery classrooms started in 2013/14, including in Muriundu, Murungaru, St Johns and Limuko primary schools, have stalled at the lintel stage.Barely two years since construction started, some classrooms already have cracking walls and chirped floors that need immediate attention for welfare of learners.In Soini ward, the county built an ECDE classroom in Mosop Primary School, but challenges still facing pupils include lack of a fence around the school compound, congestion in the classrooms and lack of offices and staff room for the teachers.The&nbsp;report&nbsp;says&nbsp;the school needs furniture and teaching aids because teachers have a hard time buying chalk and other materials on their own. Another challenge is lack of toilets.Durability of the classrooms is also questionable. The floor of Kapkechui ECDE classroom built in 2013/14 is already cracking and the roofing materials used are not of the recommended standard and have not been installed correctly.&quot;Painting has not been done as required. In addition, furniture, teaching materials and ECDE teachers have not been made available to commence learning,&quot; states the&nbsp;report.According to the&nbsp;report, Mutuiku ECDE centre in Mosop ward started in 2014/15 was poorly done as the floors have cracks all over, an indication that the red-oxide was not mixed well with cement and this is hazardous to the children&#39;s health ad hygiene.The windows were also not well done as the glasses are already falling out, exposing the children to cold breeze. The two classrooms are also congested.The&nbsp;report&nbsp;adds that floors of classrooms at Atebwo ECDE centre are also cracking. The staircase is also too steep and risky for little children.The school further lacks furniture, teaching aids and sanitation facilities such as latrines. The project is said to have been done hurriedly, in approximately two to three weeks, leading to poor finishing.
