African Airlines Association (AFRAA) Secretary General Dr Elijah Chingosho has described the agreement to control carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached at the 39th assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal Canada recently as the world&#39;s first climate deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international air travel. &quot;We in AFRAA incorporating 37 airlines across the continent with a representation of 85 per cent of total international traffic carried by African airlines applaud this landmark deal struck after tense negotiations by 191 states and various stake holders. African airlines and institutions have consistently advocated for a global solution to the menace for several years,&quot; he stated. Dr Chingosho said the historic agreement was significant because the Paris agreement reached at last year&#39;s COP21summit in Paris did not cover aviation and shipping. &quot;The agreement ensures that the aviation industry can meet its economic and social contributions in an environmentally sustainable manner,&quot; he said. He said it was heartening that countries such as China, the United States , Australia, Japan and members of the European Union that contribute the most to the global air transport and aviation pollution had signed to implement the system. &quot;The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) will complement a raft of mitigation measures to air transport industry has been looking for to cut COI2 emissions. This includes improved aircraft technology, efficient infrastructure , operational measures at airports and expanded use of sustainable alternative fuels,&quot; states Dr Chingosho.
