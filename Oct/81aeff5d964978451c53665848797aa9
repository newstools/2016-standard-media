He said during this time, the country&rsquo;s spending, which he has to police has grown from Sh1 trillion to Sh2.3 trillion.He said part of the reforms he will be spearheading will include an audit of transactions which are done off the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS).&ldquo;When the ministry reports figures that are higher than those that were budgeted for, what are they using to draw, the rules are clear, the budget is very crucial ....so if you overspend you must come back to parliament,&rdquo; he said.Ouko said he wants his office to shift from waiting for the end of each audit period to go hunting in ministries for vouchers but look at expenditure, budgetary allocation, physical verification on the ground and identifying the accounting officer.The Auditor General was speaking during the launch of the launch of a guide to understanding the national and county audits developed by the civil society groups led by the Parliamentary Initiatives Network (PIN).The civil society want the budget process improved to break down audit queries into the years they occurred to bring clarity and track the ministries that do not address the issues raised by Ouko. They also want the parliamentary committees to use the auditor&rsquo;s report during budgetary allocations to ministries, departments and agencies and reward and punish each according to how they have used resources the previous year.&ldquo;We need to see the data in a historical context, some issues are settled, while others keep recurring and citizens need to follow up the issues,&rdquo; the Institute of Economic Affairs CEO Kwame Owino said.
