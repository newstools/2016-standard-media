An AP officer and a female college student were yesterday charged with robbing Tharaka Nithi Deputy Governor Eliud Mati of Sh3.5 million.Josphat Kipyegon and Rose Kajira appeared before Principal Magistrate Stella Abuya and denied the charges of robbery with violence and handling stolen property respectively. Mr Kipyegon was charged with being armed with a firearm containing 12 bullets and robbing Mr Mati of the money in Kinoru, Meru County, on October 12.Ms Kajira, who appeared pensive, was accused of depositing Sh1.4 million, suspected to be part of the stolen money, in a KCB account in Isiolo County on the same date.Both pleaded not guilty and were remanded in custody in spite of a spirited attempt by their lawyers to get them out on the argument that one was a police officer and the other a student.SEVEN DAYSDefence lawyers Kiautha Arithi and Kiogora Mugambi differed with State Counsel Antony Musyoka, who asked the magistrate to detain the two in police custody for seven days to enable them to complete investigations.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see why the accused have been charged before conclusion of investigations,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Mr Mugambi.He also claimed Kipyegon&rsquo;s house within the deputy governor&rsquo;s compound had been ransacked and his Sh80,000 stolen.&ldquo;He cannot access his house and everything has been taken,&rdquo; he said.Ms Abuya said Kipyegon was free to report the matter to the police.But Mr Kiogora quoted detectives handling the case from a newspaper story (not The Standard) who said they had completed investigations.He said there was no rationale behind bringing the two to court if investigations had not been completed.Mr Arithi termed the investigation &ldquo;unprofessional&rdquo; and tantamount to prosecuting his client through the media.PUBLIC OPINIONHe said the matter in court was robbery with violence, adding that there was an attempt to put public opinion in the case.&ldquo;This court does not adjudicate on matters emotion, mercy. This is robbery,&rdquo; he said.Arithi said there was no need for the police to speak to the media then come to court and say they needed more time.He said four working days had elapsed since the two were arrested, adding that Kajira had been tortured while in custody and required medical attention.&ldquo;Why should she continue suffering in custody? The matter has been blown out of proportion,&rdquo; said Arithi.The magistrate denied the accused bail but ordered Kajira taken to the Meru Level 5 Hospital for treatment.She also ordered the accused to be supplied with statements and a charge sheet.
