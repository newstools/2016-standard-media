Opposition MPs who openly expressed their support for the ruling Jubilee coalition have been pulled out of key Parliament committees.The move has so far affected seven ODM MPs who have lost privileges like committee sitting allowances.The rebel MPs are also facing disciplinary proceedings instituted by the party and risk losing their seats for associating with the Jubilee coalition. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi yesterday confirmed receiving a letter from CORD discharging members who had abandoned the Opposition and crossed the floor to the ruling coalition.Those axed are James Rege (Karachuonyo), Kubai Iringo (Igembe Central), Ababu Namwamba (Budalang&#39;i), Isaac Mwaura (nominated), John Waluke (Sirisia), Mpuri Aburi (Tigania East) and Stephen Kariuki (Mathare).The affected members have announced that they will not be defending their seats on the Opposition coalition ticket, effectively placing them at loggerheads with CORD leadership in Parliament.&quot;The discharge takes place with immediate effect,&quot; said the Speaker, even as he reminded the coalition to remember the provisions of the Standing Orders that such members must be replaced within 14 days.The discharged members are part of a larger group of MPs who have abandoned the Opposition but are yet to write to the Clerk of the National Assembly to formally vacate their parliamentary seats.The implication of the discharge is that the members cannot participate in committee business and will also miss out on allowances available to House committee members.It also marks the latest twist in the frosty relationship between the defectors and the Opposition coalition, which has already subjected them to disciplinary hearings.The discharge from the committees was not taken kindly by affected members, who accused their party of treating them unfairly.&quot;I am very perturbed by the decision by ODM to remove me from the House committees. They are lucky to have an MP from Meru,&quot; said Mr Iringo.
