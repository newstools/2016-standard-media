NAIVASHA, KENYA: Experts and stakeholders around Lake Naivasha are warning that the emergence of hook and line fishing method poses a grave danger to fish production in the area. They have warned that all the gains made in the lake could be eroded if the system that targets brooders was not contained. According to the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KEMFRI), the illegal system was on the rise mainly along South Lake region. According to a researcher with KEMFRI James Last, the new fishing system could adversely affect fish production in the water-body. He noted that this was being practiced on the shores of the lake and on breeding areas which was against the law. &quot;Some fishermen and poachers have reverted to using hook and line method in which they use ugali to trap the fish and this is worrying,&quot; he said. Mr Last noted that under the system, large fish, mainly the brooders were getting caught. &quot;The illegal method is very productive compared to the use of nets and we have seen licensed fishermen opting for it,&quot; he said. The researcher at the same time said that their data indicated that the dreaded water hyacinth weed which has covered many landing beaches had stagnated. &quot;Cases of illegal fishing are very high and the biggest challenge facing this water body is the papyrus weed and not the water hyacinth,&quot; he said. On his part, the chairman Lake Naivasha boat owners association David Kilo said that they were deeply concerned by the new fishing method.
