Seven counties in northern Kenya and at the Coast have agreed to take a common approach to uplift the living standards of residents.Speaking after unveiling the Frontier Counties Development Council (FCDC) in Marsabit, governors from the two regions said the new alliance would address the common challenges facing marginalised communities. The counties, located along the Somalia and Ethiopia borders, are Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Marsabit, Isiolo, Tana River and Lamu. Garissa Governor Nathif Jama will chair the council, which was registered under the Companies Act of 2015 on April 21 last year.The council&rsquo;s mandate on socio-economic development entails increasing trade, tourism and investment that encourage private business and advancing development and peace within the bloc.Mr Jama noted that the seven counties are among the 18 poorest and under-developed regions in the country and also among those benefiting from the Equalisation Fund.&ldquo;We are among the 18 poorest counties - the poverty rate stands at between 74 and 97 per cent. We have a lot in common and there was need to establish a caucus for regional transformation,&rdquo; he said.In a communique to the press, Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani said the counties hoped to spearhead development to enable residents and the private sector to take part in creating wealth and jobs to transform the regions&rsquo; economies.He blamed politics for the current inequalities in the counties compared to others, adding that the policy by post-independent governments had led to lack of access to services and investment.The governors pledged to set aside funds for the council&rsquo;s secretariat based in Nairobi and headed by a chief executive officer.Fight terrorismMr Yatani said the counties would have a common policy, legislation, regulatory framework and programmes. He said they would also collaborate in conflict resolution strategies and promote regional cohesion.&ldquo;We will partner in research and development in the areas of resource mapping, feasibility studies, marketing and branding strategy, and information technology among others,&rdquo; he said.To combat perennial drought in the regions, the counties will come up with common strategies on building residents&rsquo; resilience, food security and mitigation measures.Yatani said the counties would also jointly work to deter radicalisation of youth and work with the national government to fight terrorism. The counties are also eyeing funding from the World Bank to develop clean energy, water and sanitation.
