NAIROBI, KENYA: Unilever has launched the high five for hand-washing campaign to mark the Global Hand-washing Day to raise awareness of the importance of hand-washing with soap in reducing child mortality.&nbsp; The campaign is part of Unilever&rsquo;s commitment to improve the hygiene behavior among 12 million Kenyans by 2020.&nbsp;During the launch, Lifebuoy also acknowledged all schools taking part in its 21 day behaviour change programme named &ldquo;School of Five.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Our commitment is to change the hand-washing behaviours of 12 million Kenyans by 2020 through educating and empowering underprivileged communities that hand-washing with soap is one of the most effective and low cost ways to prevent infections such as diarrhoea and pneumonia,&rdquo; said Unilever East Africa&rsquo;s, CEO, Justin Apsey noted.&nbsp;He also added that High 5 for hand-washing is a symbolic gesture that transcends cultural, geographical and language barriers, galvanising local communities to adopt the lifesaving habit of handwashing with soap.&nbsp;Every year, preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia claim the lives of 2.8 million children across the globe before they reach the age of five. The first 28 days of a child&rsquo;s life are the most critical. In Kenya, more than 34,000 newborn babies die each year within their first month of life &ndash; a figure that translates to more than 90 deaths per day.&nbsp;Such deaths can be significantly reduced if children, mothers and caregivers alike are taught to embrace the simple, yet often neglected act of hand-washing with soap.Global Hand-washing Day shines the spotlight on the state of hand-washing around the world, with the aim to foster and support a global and local culture of hand-washing with soap. Lifebuoy is spearheading this year&rsquo;s efforts with its High 5 for hand-washing initiative to raise awareness and instill the habit of hand-washing with soap.&nbsp;High 5 campaign advocates for greater use of simple and cost effective hygiene interventions like hand-washing with soap.&nbsp;
