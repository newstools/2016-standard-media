Most new nursery education facilities built by Nakuru county government are in poor state, with muddy walls, dusty floors and with no doors or windows.Even as the children clutch onto their tiny bags and brave the early morning cold breeze to acquire education, every day they meet an unwelcoming environment and demoralised teachers.According to a County Assembly report on public works project for financial year 2014/15, most Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) classrooms initiated by the county government are incomplete and some are substandard. Some of the ECDE classrooms are dusty, have cracked walls and floors and are congested, posing health risks to the children.At Hyrax Primary School in Nakuru Town East Sub-county, the ECDE classroom is incomplete, its floor is muddy, and doors and windows are not fixed.School headteacher Hudson Gitau has been forced to find an alternative for the pupils. The pupils in baby class, middle class and top class are now put in one classroom that is divided by ragged sacks.The children share limited tables and use stones and timber to prop the blackboard.&ldquo;This is the only alternative in ensuring young ones access education. The county has been reluctant to complete the structure started last year,&rdquo; says Mr Gitau.Despite not having received her promised Sh8,000 salary, Trizer Wairimu is a dedicated teacher.Tiresome and demoralising&ldquo;I love my work. As you can see, it is not easy to manage these children because they are at their most active stage, some come to class reluctant to learn, some cry for their parents while others keeps moving up and down. It is tiresome and demoralising when you haven&rsquo;t received any pay from their parents,&rdquo; says Ms Wairimu.At Kibowen Komen Primary School in Nakuru West, baby class and middle class pupils study under one roof provided by the primary section. The ECDE has 61 pupils.Headteacher David Mutai says despite requesting the county to build a nursery classroom, nothing has been done.Anastacia Gathoni, the ECDE teacher, says quality of education is affected by high dropout rate attributed to unwillingness by the parents to pay a termly fee of Sh700. Ms Gathoni says she has been in the school for four months, but has only received Sh2,000 so far.The case is not different in NJoro Sub-county where the county has built classrooms, but they are not equipped and lack trained teachers. Some schools employ Sunday school teachers after the county failed to employ trained tutors.At Njoro Central Primary, teacher Mary Mwikali tells The Standard on Sunday that since she was employed, she has never earned more than Sh4,000 a month, despite having a diploma in ECDE.Ms Mwikali says parents also struggle to have learning materials such as exercise books and pencils.&ldquo;Look, how would you assist such a child who does not have writing materials? The book is filled up and I am forced to give her papers to write on,&rdquo; she says, with the pupil standing by.The challenge is not different in Kaiyaba Primary School, where most pupils are from humble families that practice small-scale farming for a living. Each pupil is required to pay Sh750 per term, an agreement that is not honoured.&ldquo;What drives me to class is my love for these young children. There are times I get discouraged working without pay, but I am encouraged that some day, the county government will employ teachers,&rdquo; teacher Mary Wairimu says hopefully.Ms Wairimu, who joined the school in January, holds a diploma in ECDE and was employed by parents who pay her little money. She has been looking forward to being employed by the county after several applications.County Education executive Francis Mathea said it is unfortunate that parents still pay school fees for their children to access early childhood education, a mischief &ldquo;inherited from the national government&rdquo;.He said there are plans to employ 220 trained nursery school teachers against the required number of at least 600 in the entire county.&ldquo;Employment of ECDE teachers is being done gradually to ensure children access quality education. Though parents pay school fees now, strategies are underway to make ECDE free for all pupils once we employ the teachers,&rdquo; said Mathea.Mathea said ECDE teachers will be paid depending on an individual&rsquo;s academic qualifications and experience.&ldquo;County Public Service Board is currently working on salaries for the teachers that will be determined by various factors, for example there are certificate, diploma and degree holders and the salaries will vary,&rdquo; he said.Concerning poor sanitation and dusty classrooms learners are exposed to, Mathea said the department wants to wipe out temporary structures and construct descent classrooms and toilets.He since 2013, the county has built a total of 485 ECDE centres, some of which have been equipped.
