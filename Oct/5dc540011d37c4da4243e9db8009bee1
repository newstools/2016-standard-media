Earlier in the morning, the President unveiled freedom fighter Paul Ngei&#39;s statue at Chumvi junction along Mbolu Malu Road.Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua had also unveiled a statue of veteran freedom fighter Muindi Mbingu.Kenyans donning red T-shirts written Mashujaa started arriving at the stadium earlier than 6am.There were already long queues by 7am, indicating the enthusiasm of locals to attend the national function.Thursday&#39;s function was the second national event to be held outside Nairobi after June 1 Madaraka Day held in Nakuru.It was the seventh celebration in honour of the country&#39;s freedom fighters. Initially it was named Kenyatta Day and was renamed after the promulgation of 2010 Constitution.There was a near-stampede at one of the stadium&#39;s entrances as locals locked out because of space shoved to make their way into the stadium.Locked outA section of the crowd had been locked out of the field and were only allowed in after the military had mounted a guard in honour of the Head of State.It was the first official State function for new Chief Justice David Maranga, just a day after his swearing as the President of the Judiciary.The CJ sat between National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and Governor Mutua in the main dais&#39; front row, just two steps away from the Head of State.And when President Uhuru took to the podium, Maraga received a full in-tray.Uhuru released about 7,000 petty offenders and, with a light touch, instructed Maraga to prosecute big thieves since there was now space in prisons.Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) leaders Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&#39;ula arrived about a half-an-hour after the Head of State and walked straight to the main dais to shake hands with senior government officials.Opposition chief Raila Odinga skipped the event since he had travelled to London to give a talk on Sunday.There was an awkward moment when the organisers had to scamper to create sitting space for the two leaders.Unlike previous such functions, Thursday&#39;s celebration had traditional songs and dances from across the country.Only Groove Award winner Mercy Masika performed contemporary gospel music. She charged the crowd with her hit &quot;Wema Wako&quot; song just before Governor Mutua took to the podium.
