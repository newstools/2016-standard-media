Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has urged voters in Meru County to ignore Governor Peter Munya and his new-found political vehicle, the Party of National Unity (PNU).&nbsp;He said Munya should not take Jubilee leaders for a ride by claiming he will support President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s 2017 re-election bid, when the PNU head has stated that he would be vying for the presidency in 2022.&quot;President Uhuru&#39;s 2017 re-election and his deputy William Ruto&#39;s 2022 election are intertwined. How can Munya expect Ruto to support the President in 2017 then go home? How will his (Ruto&#39;s) people think? PNU is spoiling Uhuru&#39;s chances in 2017,&quot; stated Kiunjuri. The CS was speaking&nbsp;Saturday at Ntugi in Buuri sub-county during the burial of Peter Karaini, the father of Patricia Muthoni, the CS&#39;s aide.&nbsp;
