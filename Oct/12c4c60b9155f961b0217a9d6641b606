Small&nbsp;parties&nbsp;are waging a political war against Jubilee&nbsp;Party&nbsp;and&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;in the Nyacheki ward by-election slated for Wednesday.The by-election has attracted heated campaigns, with Opposition leader Raila Odinga expected to drum up support for&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;candidate Naftal Onkoba on Monday.Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution former chairman Charles Nyachae and Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi have been leading the campaigns for Jubilee candidate Maxwell Magoma. Bobasi MP Stephen Manoti, his Nyaribari Chache counterpart Richard Tongi and former Ford People Chairman Albert Nyaundi have also been campaigning for Magoma.ODM&nbsp;Chairman John Mbadi, Treasurer Timothy Bosire, Kisii Governor James Ongwae and Dagoreti North MP Simba Arati have been campaigning for Onkoba.But even as the two leading&nbsp;parties&nbsp;plan to hit the ground for last minute campaigns, Kenya National Congress (KNC) candidate Caleb Onguti and National Vison&nbsp;Party&#39;s (NVP) Moracha Mochache could pull a surprise in the area that is largely a support base for Kisii Senator Chris Obure, who is yet to campaign for any aspirant.Other candidates are Kennedy Arama (Chama Cha Uzalendo), Morang&#39;a Mekubo (CMD), Zechariah Nyagaka (Chama Cha Mashinani), Ezekiel Magati (Labour&nbsp;Party&nbsp;of Kenya), Walter Mokua (Ford Kenya) and Samuel Nyabuto (People&#39;s Democratic&nbsp;Party), Peter Oibi (Maendeleo Democratic&nbsp;Party), Isaac Mogocha (Wiper) and Justus Nyaberi of Progressive&nbsp;Party&nbsp;of Kenya.The&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;leaders accused Jubilee of using money to influence voters ahead of the by-election.After losing the&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;nominations, Onguti decamped to KNC,&nbsp;party&nbsp;South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya is planning to use to vie for the Kisii governor&#39;s seat.Onguti&rsquo;s win will give Nyamweya a head start for his bid and will send booth JP and&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;back to the drawing board. The two&nbsp;parties&nbsp;are&nbsp;fighting&nbsp;for the Kisii votes in next year&rsquo;s elections.Yesterday, Bosire said&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;will leave nothing to chance to clinch the seat.&quot;We believe in the youth to drive our agenda in the area. The electorate is mature enough to know who the right candidate is. We are not only campaigning for our Nyacheki candidate, but also for our&nbsp;party&nbsp;leader who is our presidential candidate,&quot; said Bosire.The ward has 10,924 registered voters. IEBC South Nyanza coordinator Sarah Ogaro said they were already set for the poll.&quot;We have 23 voting centres and vote tallying will be done at Isena Mixed Secondary School,&quot; she said.&nbsp;
