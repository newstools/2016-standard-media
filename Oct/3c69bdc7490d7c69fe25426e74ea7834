A man claiming to be the son of the late William ole Ntimama wants his remain exhumed for a DNA test. George Kariuki Njoroge went to court seeking orders to have tissue samples taken from the body for analysis as he seeks to prove that Ntimama was his father. In an amended petition through lawyer Nicholas Njagi, Mr Njoroge wants the court to compel Ntimama&#39;s widow, Dorcas Pedelei Ntimama, and other family members to allow him to extract the tissue samples. Njoroge also wants the court to declare him a beneficiary of Ntimama&#39;s estate. &quot;I want the court to declare that I am entitled by law to have the name of the late Ntimama and that I am his biological son,&quot; said Njoroge before Justice Joseph Onguto. However, the case did not proceed yesterday as Mr Njagi was not ready. Onguto directed they return on November 20, when he will hear oral submissions from both parties.
