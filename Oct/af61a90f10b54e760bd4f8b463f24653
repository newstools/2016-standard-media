Susan Kamau, CEO of the Kenyan Kitchen, is on a digital media campaign with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to help increase adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels in Kenya. To her, cooking should not kill but should be pleasurable.She is using the social media platform to provide information on the negative impact of inefficient cooking and highlight the benefits of switching to cleaner, more efficient cook stoves and fuels. The site is also inviting Kenyans to participate directly by sharing a photo of themselves and others cooking for the chance to win a prize.&ldquo;I was stunned when I first learnt of the huge number of people impacted by inefficient, harmful cooking in Kenya and globally,&rdquo; she says.Susan wants the campaign to help build awareness about clean cooking saying while some Kenyans know the negative impact of cooking smoke, many are not aware of how clean and efficient cook stoves and fuels can benefit them on a daily basis.Statistics show that traditional cook stoves and open fires are the primary means of cooking and heating for nearly three billion people in the developing world. These also cause more than four million premature deaths, including 15,700 deaths in Kenya, every year.The smoke also contributes to a range of chronic illnesses and acute health impact such as early childhood pneumonia, emphysema, cataracts, lung cancer, bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, and low birth weight.&ldquo;Use of clean, safe and efficient cook stoves protects one from exposure to harmful smoke.It also dramatically reduces fuel consumption hence reducing pressure on forests.They have the potential to provide economic opportunities throughout the value chain as well as saving time spent in fuel wood collection that can be used for more productive purposes,&rdquo; Susan says.To ensure that the campaign is successful, Susan is working very closely with Clean Cookstoves Association of Kenya (CCAK) whose focus is promoting the clean cooking sector.&ldquo;We are excited that we are now seeing numerous efforts geared towards increasing the demand of clean cooking technologies and fuels.Increasing the use of these household energy solutions are essential to improving our country&rsquo;s health and well-being, environment, and economy,&rdquo; said Myra Mukulu, CCAK Executive Secretary.
