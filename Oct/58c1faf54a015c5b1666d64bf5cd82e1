Infinity Industrial Park has been unveiled. The management estimates that the park valued at&nbsp;Sh12.5 billion will accommodate 800-1000 small and medium scale industries.The park is located off the Eastern bypass, accessible by both Thika Super Highway and Mombasa road. During the ground breaking ceremony yesterday, Cabinet Secretary for Trade and Cooperatives Adan Mohamed said the Government launched the Kenya Industrial Transformation programme to drive the industrialisation agenda. A key component of this programme, he said, is the provision of industrial zones and parks.&ldquo;This enabler will transform the way we do business in this country. Industrialised nations have used this model successfully in the past and we will not be left behind,&rdquo; said Mohamed. Social amenitiesHe said the Government is employing public private partnership model through Economic Zones Act 2015, which allows a waiver of taxes on materials used to construct industrial parks. &ldquo;As you may be aware, the Government last year through my ministry rolled out incentives to attract the development of industrial parks by waiving input taxes on raw materials used in the development of parks of more than 100 acres,&rdquo; said Mohamed.The park, which is set on 200 acres, will be the second largest industrial park on the eastern bypass after the 450-acre Tatu City. The park will come with social amenities like a police station, waste management system, modern shopping mall, industrial sheds for SMEs, 24- hour security patrol, public transport stage, fire station, hospital and power station.&ldquo;Infinity presents an extra-ordinary &ldquo;all-in-one-place&rdquo; opportunity for SME&rsquo;s to locate their operations as part of their long term strategic plans in a top class secure environment,&rdquo; said Mr Ashok Rupshi Shah, Infinity&rsquo;s Chairman and Managing Director.&ldquo;The concept I am introducing is called &ldquo;plug and play&rdquo;, where entrepreneurs set up their businesses without worrying about the necessary infrastructure.&rdquo;&nbsp;
