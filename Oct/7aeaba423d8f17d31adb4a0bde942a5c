Water hyacinth has, for many years, been considered a nuisance that affects fishing and navigation in Lake Victoria.While many residents would do anything to be rid of the &lsquo;obnoxious&rsquo; weed, a youth group from Migori are turning the weed into green gold.The group, Jiamini Unaweza (believe you can), have been using the hyacinth&rsquo;s leaves, stems and roots to enrich their locally-made papers and the results were impressive. The project started four years ago when, the then group of garbage collectors, were challenged to do more with the waste they were collecting and they started to recycle waste papers.The group&rsquo;s leader Michael Evans Oloo, 30, says they would sort polythene and glass waste which they would sell but burn the papers.&ldquo;One of the individuals we were selling these waste materials to gave us an idea that we could recycle paper instead of burning it. It was in the form of a challenge and once we thought through it, we decided to go ahead with it,&rdquo; he says.To begin the recycling process, Oloo says they first cut the papers into small pieces and then dip these in water and stir to form a thick mixture before adding wood glue to bind it.The team collects between 20 to 40 kilogrammes of water hyacinth from the lake using a motorboat. The stem and leaves are first let to undergo a process like decomposing to soften them. After this, they are boiled together with the roots and this concoction is then added into the mixture where the small pieces of paper are put.Some of the products the group makes out of this hyacinth-blended papers include unique envelopes, folders, success cards, scramble books, book covers, gift bags as well us artistic works such as drawings.Oloo says they were only five when they started out in 2012 but the number has since grown to 17.&ldquo;The main aim of this group was to reduce joblessness by providing a platform for talented youth to explore their gifts.We however, sell very little since we depend on tourists who only come occasionally,&rdquo; he said.However, despite these challenges the youth believe if their innovation is commercialised it can help to curb pollution occasioned by burning of papers as well as eradication the obnoxious weed from the lake.
