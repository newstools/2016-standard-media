&nbsp;A State agency has banned large-scale harvesting of water from rivers in the semi-arid Narok County as drought continues to ravage the area.The Water Resources Management Authority (Warma), which has been conducting a week-long operation to deter the practice along River Narosura in Narok South sub-county, impounded about 20 generators used to pump water illegally. The move came following an outcry about the receding water levels in the river by people living downstream.Warma South Rift Regional Manager Samuel Gor said some unscrupulous farmers were drawing water from the river for irrigation without permits, depriving those living downstream enough water for domestic use and for their livestock.&quot;The Water Act states that no person shall, without authority willfully obstruct, interfere with, divert any water from any watercourse or any water resource, or negligently allow any such obstruction, interference, diversion or obstruction,&quot; said Gor.The Warma official said water levels in most rivers in the area were on the decline due to unregulated irrigation activities and the prevailing dry spell.He urged residents to be on the look-out for those flouting the law and report them to the authorities for prosecution, adding that chiefs should be in the forefront in sensitizing residents on water laws.Mr Gor said water remains a property of the State and it is the authority&#39;s duty to regulate the resource.The county is one of the regions worst hit by drought in the country.
