Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka now says said he will not fight to retain leaders who defected to Jubilee party.Addressing Thursday&#39;s Mashujaa Day celebrations at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos town, Kalonzo also told off a section of Ukambani Members of Parliament who had given him 30-day ultimatum to convene a meeting all leaders to chart way for the region&#39;s political future.Kalonzo advised them to stop issuing ultimatums, and instead focus on their new found home, the Jubilee Party. &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s just the other day when some leaders decamped from my party to Jubilee, including my Governor here, Alfred Mutua and I want to officially hand them over to you with effect from today,&quot; he said.Several MPs who decamped to JP were present at the ceremony including Mutambu, Kisoi, Mwangangi, Victor Munyaka (Machakos Town), Vincent Musyoka (Mwala) and Itwiku Mbai (Masinga).Not keenKalonzo&#39;s declaration was interpreted by many to imply that he was not keen on engaging the defectors, who had threatened they would make a &#39;major declaration&#39; on their own should the Wiper party leader fail to heed to their demands.Speaking after the celebrations, Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambo, who is among the MPs who had issued the ultimatum, said Kalonzo&#39;s attack on party defectors was uncalled for.&quot;Saying that he had handed over those who have defected to Jubilee was demeaning,&quot; he said.But Machakos deputy governor, Bernard Kiala, praised Kalonzo, describing his speech as bold.&quot;He (Kalonzo) is my hero today because he has managed to speak to millions of Kenyans,&quot; he said.Kalonzo&#39;s allies, including Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama and Woman Representative Susan Musyoka did not attend the event.
