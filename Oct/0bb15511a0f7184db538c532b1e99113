Ten bodies of those killed in the Mandera terror attack have been transferred from Chiromo to City Mortuary for postmortem.National Disaster Management Unit deputy director Pius Masai said autopsies on the bodies that have been identified were to be carried out last evening before the remains are taken back to Chiromo.&quot;The Government pathologist has requested for postmortem to be done in City Mortuary because of other engagements. The bodies will then be brought back and released to the families after all other procedures have been met including recording statements,&quot; said Masai. However, sources at Chiromo told The Standard pathologists had refused to perform the autopsies at their facility in protest after the Government failed to pay them for similar services following a similar attack in Mandera.&quot;We are told the pathologist has refused to show up until she is paid. There is a standoff because the National Disaster Operation Centre officials are arguing that since it is a national disaster, the Government pathologist is not supposed to be paid,&quot; said the source.A postmortem is said to be charged at Sh15,000 per body.&quot;During all other tragedies including the Tana delta, the pathologists were paid,&quot; said the source.But Chief Government Pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor said they changed postmortem location from Chiromo to City Mortuary due to facilities.&quot;The facility at Chiromo is not as good. City mortuary has more autopsy tables,&quot; said Dr Oduor.The source said there had been plans also to have the postmortems done at a private mortuary at Sh14,000 per body.&quot;Chiromo is more equipped than City by far. We have big storage facilities and also provide reconstructive surgery,&quot; said the source.The bodies that have so far been identified are those of two actors and eight quarry workers. They include artistes Lisa Achieng and Kennedy Kinyanjui, from Homa Bay and Nakuru counties respectively, and quarry worker Edward Nyongesa from Kakamega County.Most of the victims were quarry workers from Nyeri County including Richard Wangu, Amos Ndungu, Simon Mwangi, James Maina, Francis Makumi, Joseph Muriuki and business man David Kariuki from Embu County.
