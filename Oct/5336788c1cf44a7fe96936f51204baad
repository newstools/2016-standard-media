The Authority says the initiative will see some 44 school libraries across the country equipped with computer labs in keeping with its mandate of making ICT services accessible to the majority of Kenyans.Last week, the Authority donated 50 computers, three printers, screen projector and Internet connectivity worth Sh6.6million to Kwale Boys High School in Kwale County as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).The computer handover ceremony was held at the school grounds presided over by CA Director General Mr. Francis Wangusi and Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The total cost of our support is Kenya shilling 6,671,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, this is the largest CSR project that the Authority has undertaken in one institution.&nbsp; I therefore urge the school administration and students to take care of the facility, including the computers and other accessories that we have donated&rsquo;, Mr. Wangusi said during the handover ceremony.The Authority has supported similar initiatives in other secondary schools under our CSR programme.&nbsp; Last year, the Authority facilitated the establishment of a computer lab for Gathaithi Mixed Secondary School in Kiambu, where we donated a total of 30 computers.In February 2015, the Authority as a good corporate citizen, constructed six classrooms, an administration block and textbooks to Masaba DEB Primary School in Western Kenya.He added that CA is very passionate in extending ICT support to schools, largely due the need to lay the foundation for the next generation of innovators in the country.&nbsp; Kenya is already emerging as an ICT innovation hub in the region and indeed globally.In the current financial year, the Authority is planning to roll out the School Broadband Connectivity project with funding from the Universal Service Fund.&nbsp; This project, which will involve providing broadband connectivity to over 800 secondary schools located in the 47 counties.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kwale County the schools earmarked for the broadband connectivity includes, Kwale Boys High School, Tsimba Secondary School, Golini Secondary School, Waa Boys High School, Waa Girls Secondary School, Matuga Girls High school, and Kingwede Secondary schoolThe Kwale Boys computer lab was unveiled during the 11th Edition of the county ICT consumer forum dubbed Kikao Kikuu held in Kwale County.These forums seek to empower consumers of communications services to make better and informed purchases and also understand their rights and obligations.The underlying theme was &lsquo;Child Online Protection&rsquo; and various stakeholders in ICT were engaged to discuss the threats posed by child exposure to cyber space and deliberate on the way forward to ensure safety of children online.
