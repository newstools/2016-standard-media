Uncertainty looms in the banking sector on whether to loan more as lenders prepare to take the biggest hit from the new law capping interest rates, according to a banking report.The report by Standard Investment Bank (SIB) pointed out that some banks have decided to play the volumes game hoping the numbers will plug the shortfall in revenues from interest income, while others fear this strategy could create another spike in bad loans and hurt their bottom line. Cooperative Bank, which was processing 250 loans a day has reported a five-time increase and is currently processing 1,250-1,300 loans across the business spectrum, while Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), the country&rsquo;s largest lender by assets, said it had increased lending from Sh1 billion to Sh6.3 billion. REFINANCINGHowever, most of these are not new loans but from clients who already have facilities but took advantage of the friendly interest regime to seek refinance. KCB chief executive Joshua Oigara reckons most of the lending by the bank had come as top-ups on existing loans, while Co-op Bank puts 70 per cent of its lending to borrowers seeking to refinance their loans and 30 per cent as new loan requests.Mr Jibran Qureishi, Economist at CfC Stanbic Bank said increasing loan volumes would not be ideal for banks as they will have to make bigger provisions in case of higher defaults, which will further shrink their declared profits.&ldquo;They could dig themselves into a deeper hole. Increasing loan volumes could lead to another round of increased credit provisioning as the rate cap won&rsquo;t improve the credit quality of borrowers,&rdquo; explained Qureishi.This comes even as Central Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge raised concerns over the huge fall in private sector credit.The amount of loans extended by banks to private sector fell to 7.1 per cent year on year in July, up from 18 per cent recorded in December and 20.8 per cent in September last year. During this review period, there was rise in interest rates that could have informed the increased loan uptake.Standard Investment Bank (SIB), however, says it did not see a surge in the loans.The CBK&rsquo;s July 2016 banks&rsquo; credit survey pointed to dim loan growth prospects, where only a quarter of 11 sectors of the economy had an increase in demand for loans, a position the bank says will likely continue in the next few months.SIB researchers say the prevailing high sector Non-Performing Loan ratio would likely translate into pull-back in risky lending and the adoption of risk mitigating policies by banks, including demanding more collateral and shortening the loan tenure. These measures, it notes, will dampen credit demand further.Their research shows that since corporate clients who take-up 47 per cent of the sector&rsquo;s loan book are already borrowing at lower rates, the new law capping the rate hardly benefits them, hence lenders do not expect increase in borrowing from this key market segment.EASY BORROWINGTherefore, for banks to increase their lending, they have to loosen credit standards, a doubtful scenario given the risk of bad loans.Qureishi sees a dimmer prospect for banks&rsquo; profitability moving forward even as the Central Bank may likely cut its rates further in response to fall in inflation.Even worse would be if a proposal by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich to raise commercial bank&rsquo;s core capital requirement to Sh5 billion from Sh1 billion. This would erode banks&rsquo; working capital.
