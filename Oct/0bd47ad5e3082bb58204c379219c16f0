Deputy President William Ruto&rsquo;s forays into Ukambani have generated unease among leaders in the region.The leaders are particularly uneasy with Ruto&rsquo;s direct appeal to Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join the Jubilee Party. On Tuesday, Ruto appealed to the Wiper Party leader to cross over to Jubilee, saying there was a power struggle within the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) where Kalonzo is competing with Raila Odinga and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula for the Opposition&rsquo;s presidential ticket.Addressing meetings in Kibwezi and Emali towns in Makueni County, Ruto said Kalonzo&rsquo;s political survival in the Opposition was untenable.Gather courage&ldquo;We welcome your leader to gather courage and cross over to this other side because in his own words he has indicated that CORD is a house full of trouble,&rdquo; said Ruto.The DP rallied the region to back the newly formed party, saying the community would reap more benefits by working with the Government than with the Opposition.&ldquo;It is crystal clear that JP will win the next General Election and it is only fair for the community to ensure its stake in the next government is guaranteed,&rdquo; he said.The promised a bag of goodies for Lower Eastern, including the Sh54 billion Thwake multi-purpose dam whose construction will begin in January.&ldquo;The Sh54 billion Thwake dam will be the single largest dam investment in independent Kenya and will take around three years to complete. We are doing that because we have taken cognisance of the pressing water crisis in Ukambani,&rdquo; he said.So far, Sh1.4 billion had been set aside to compensate local residents affected by the dam, which will serve large-scale agricultural activities, hydro-power generation and domestic consumption.Ruto also announced that President Uhuru Kenyatta will on October 21 commission the tarmacking of the Kibwezi-Mutomo road at a cost of Sh14 billion.The DP told the Kamba community that there was no reason for them to vote against the ruling coalition since the Government had demonstrated willingness to prioritise the region in the distribution of resources.&ldquo;The Jubilee administration has done the best for this region in terms of appointments to key Government positions as well as initiating key development projects to improve the living standards of the locals and therefore it is up to you to make your choice,&rdquo; he said.But it is the invitation for Kalonzo to join Jubilee that has rattled his allies within CORD.Steer clearSenator David Musila (Kitui), Johnstone Muthama (Machakos) and&nbsp; National Assembly members Junet Mohammed (Suna East) and Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) dismissed the DP&rsquo;s call and told him to steer clear of CORD affairs.&ldquo;I want to make it absolutely clear that Kalonzo and Wiper have never at any time considered joining Jubilee, &ldquo; said Musila, who is the Wiper Party chairman.Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana denied reports that Kalonzo had hinted that he was ready to join Jubilee.&ldquo;Kalonzo Musyoka has not as yet told us what other options he had in mind and therefore we cannot second-guess him,&rdquo; said Kibwana.Senator Muthama, who is also the Senate Minority Whip and a close ally of Musyoka, wondered why the DP would woo leaders from the region with a promise of development.&ldquo;If you come to us with these conditions, it is misguided and cheap politics. What some leaders are following is his deep pockets and not policies,&rdquo; he said.Muthama mocked the DP for pressing for merger of Jubilee parties.&ldquo;It is wrong to see a person like the DP calling other leaders to leave their parties and come join them. Kenya is a multiparty state,&rdquo; he said. Wandayi, who is also the ODM Political Affairs secretary, accused the DP employing divide-and-rule tactics.However, nominated MP Johnston Sakaja said Jubilee party will reach out to all Kenyans.&ldquo;We are opening up to work with everybody irrespective of which side of the political divide they are in,&rdquo; he said.
