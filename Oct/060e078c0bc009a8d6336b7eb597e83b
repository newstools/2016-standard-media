The outgoing Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) members have urged politicians to stop interfering with the agency&#39;s operations 10 months to next year&#39;s General Election.Five IEBC commissioners, led by vice chair Lilian Mahiri-Zaja, said politicians should let the incoming commission perform its duties without interference.They were speaking during a thanksgiving for commissioner Thomas Letangule at his Kabarak home in Nakuru County yesterday. Other commissioners in the ceremony, also attended by Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Alex ole Magelo, were Yusu Nzibo, Muthoni Wangai and Mohammed Alawi.The commissioners said their decision to leave office next month was driven by the need to uphold peace in the country.&quot;Those shouting the loudest and serving in the Senate or National Assembly have nothing against how the commission conducted elections, but their concern is why their presidential candidate was beaten. Let me assure them that if the 2013 elections were repeated today, the current president would still win,&quot; said Mr Letangule.The commissioners said it was wrong for politicians, especially elected ones, to condemn the commission that oversaw the 2013 elections through which they came to power.They said three petitions filed to have them removed from office failed, an indication that they oversaw the 2013 elections fairly. They said new commissioners will pick from where they left.The commissioners said if they had the chance to supervise the 2017 General Election, they would conduct it just as they did in 2013.They also urged Kenyans to uphold peace ahead of the elections.Mahiri-Zaja said the electoral commission has formulated an election plan to ensure the 2017 polls run smoothly.She said the incoming commissioners will have easy time to implement the plan and asked Kenyans to ignore inciting comments directed at the commission.Commissioner Alawi said, &quot;We are leaving office next month and those who will be defeated in 2017 must accept Kenyans&#39; verdict and go home like we accepted to leave office for the sake of peace and tranquility.&quot;
