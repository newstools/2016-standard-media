Deputy Chief Justice nominee Philomena Mwilu has accused Kandara MP Alice Wahome of engaging in a witch hunt.This follows the MP&#39;s petition challenging Justice Mwilu&#39;s suitability for the appointment.Ms Wahome filed a petition with the Justice and Legal Affairs committee, claiming that the judge was incompetent and corrupt. But in a rebuttal, Justice Mwilu told the committee that the MP&#39;s claims stemmed from a ruling in an International Federation of Women Lawyers (Fida) case challenging the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which Wahome lost.Ms Mwilu said since the MP, who is also a lawyer, lost the case in 2011, she had been on a mud-slinging mission against her.She said the MP first placed a complaint against her with the Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board, before which she (Wahome) testified for three hours.The board dismissed the claims for lack of evidence.&quot;She did not appear before the Judicial Service Commission when I appeared to be interviewed for this position. I was depressed when I heard my name was mentioned at a political rally where I could not reply to the allegations,&quot; said Mwilu.In her petition, the MP had also claimed that Mwilu received money to dismiss an election case in which she (Wahome) had contested the election of her predecessor, Maina Kamau.Mwilu denied the allegations, saying she had never received a bribe.The case has not been settled to date and Wahome accused the judge of incompetence.The judge however pointed out that the MP had walked out of the court when she was meant to testify.She pledged to support Chief Justice David Maraga to reform the Judiciary.The Chief Justice has recommended Mwilu for the DCJ position.
