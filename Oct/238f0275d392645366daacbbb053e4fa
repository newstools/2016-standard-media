The Ministry of Water has come to the aid of Bungoma DEB School, one of&nbsp; the most populous primary schools in the country.The ministry announced yesterday that it would drill a borehole in the school after its plight was highlighted by The Standard last week.The school&#39;s Board of Management chairman Martin Nyongesa welcomed the assistance, saying it would go a long way in making life comfortable for pupils and teachers. &quot;This will make water readily available and also help mitigate our huge water bills,&quot; he said.Addressing the press at the school yesterday, Mr Nyongesa said other organisations such as the Embassy of South Korea had indicated that they would also help the school.He said the school&#39;s population of 3,236 pupils faced many challenges ranging from lack of enough classrooms, and land for expansion to inadequate teaching staff.Some 506 candidates are expected to sit for this year&#39;s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams next week.GLOBAL STANDARDSAccording to head teacher Tobias Khisa, the school, which was established by colonialists in 1953, is operating way beyond its capacity.Each class holds up to 135 pupils, which is three times more than the recommended 45.This means each teacher handles at least 63 pupils, which is above global standards.The school has 51 tutors employed by the Teachers Service Commission.Kanduyi Constituency Development Fund chairman George Makari said they had tried to help through funding for infrastructure.
