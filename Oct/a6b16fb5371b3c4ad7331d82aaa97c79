For years, one tree stood out among the 1,000 plus species in Kakamega Forest.Known as mama Mutere, the tree stood as a towering feature of the tropical rainforest for the past 300 years before disease ravaged its roots and brought it down in June 2014. Today, the fallen trunk lies deep within the forest and continues to attract hundreds of tourists who come to see the tree believed to be the mother of all Mutere tree species in the region.To the locals, mama Mutere was more than a tree, it was a sacred shrine where they would gather to pray for rain and good harvest. It was also treasured for its medicinal value.The tree was among the most photographed in Kenya. Just like Kenya Wildlife Service has the big five, Kenya Forest Service (KFS) also has a few unique trees, which included mama Mutere.&ldquo;The tree was accorded special significance because all Mutere trees in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania got their seeds from this tree,&rdquo; said George Ayimo, Kakamega Forest Station manager.Ayimo said some 200 tourists visit the forest each month to take in its various splendours and also to see the fallen &lsquo;mother&rsquo; tree which was gazetted as a national heritage 30-years-ago.According to the forester, the tree started &lsquo;ailing&rsquo; 10 years before it fell down.&ldquo;When it got infected with disease, it started to show signs of dying after it began losing its leaves and bark. It however, remained upright but the disease spread into the roots making them rot and eventually brought it down,&rdquo; he said.David Makonjio, a tour guide at the forest, recalled when the tree &lsquo;died&rsquo; saying it was breaking news and hundreds came to see it.&ldquo;While they still come to give their &lsquo;last respects&rsquo; to its legacy, we know the tree is not entirely forgotten because it has many offspring,&rdquo; Makonjio said.Out of its &lsquo;children&rsquo; KFS has adopted one of its &lsquo;daughters&rsquo; to take the place of mama Mutere. The 200-year-old tree is situated 140 metres away from the fallen trunk.&ldquo;The tree is 50 metres high with a five meter circumference. The hardwood tree provides a beautiful shade, attracts rain and is a dwelling place for birds and other wild animals such as monkeys,&rdquo; he says.A few metres away from mama Mutere is another great feature of the forest - an Elgon teak tree thought to be over 800 years.According to Makonjio, Queen Elizabeth of England toured the forest in 1954 and when she saw the tree she ordered it be placed under Government protection.&ldquo;The tree has medicinal value as it is thought to treat gonorrhea and malaria. Its seeds take longer than a month to germinate,&rdquo; he said.Apart from these two tree species, Kakamega Forest is also home to other tree species such as the Mugumo and Museno (sandpaper tree). It also plays host to over 36 species of snakes, seven primates, flying squirrels and 510 species of snakes.Some of the primates found in the forest include: Black and white Colobus monkeys, blue monkeys, red tailed monkeys, olive baboon, depressor monkeys, vervet monkeys and potto monkeys which are seen at night only.Also, due to constant and even distribution of rainfall in the western region, the forest provides locals with a constant supply of vegetables such as jute leaves (murere), spider plant (tsisaka) and black nightshade (tsimboka), among others.Residents also harvest termites, a favourite delicacy, during the rainy season from the forest. They also gather up firewood and timber from the massive woodland.
