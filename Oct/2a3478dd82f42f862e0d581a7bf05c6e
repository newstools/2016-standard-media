The situation in Elgeyo Marakwet County needs a more serious response than what has been witnessed so far. All that the victims of what is increasingly bordering on the criminal rather than a communal pastime, have heard is talk and little action. It is shameful that citizens of a country that purports to have a robust security apparatus have been forced to seek refuge in caves due to attacks from marauding cattle rustlers. Over 20 people have been killed so far. It is tempting to imagine that what is going on at Chesogon village along the West Pokot-Elgeyo Marakwet border (where attackers pounce at will) is an unfortunate case of criminal neglect of armless citizens. Thousands have been displaced with school-going children and women the worst affected. This has to stop. Yesterday, one person was critically injured and animals stolen following an attack by Pokot raiders. The Government&rsquo;s assurance that it is doing everything to contain the situation is just that; words. READ MORE Senator Murkomen under siege as Kimaiyo guns for his seat During a tour of the region last Thursday, Deputy President William Ruto promised to immediately deploy 40 Kenya Police Reservists in each of the two sub-counties; Marakwet East and Tiaty. Barely a day after, suspected armed Pokot raiders launched an audacious attack. Though the raiders (said to be over 60) were repulsed, the shocking boldness with which they operate raises pertinent questions. How genuine are their leaders to the calls for peace? If some of the leaders are involved as alleged by some quarters, why is the Government not arresting and charging them? It is the State&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure all Kenyans are safe. The apparent lack of moral indignation, let alone the jarring inaction from the leadership, is a grave indictment of the ruling elite. Stern action is needed now. Residents of Chesogon and other Kenyans deserve no less.
