Governors are calling for cooperation between the two levels of government to effectively address growing insecurity across the country.The county bosses challenged the national government to work closely with them to combat terror and other security threats.Council of Governors Chairman Peter Munya said failure by the central government to foster rapport with counties is to blame for some terror attacks that have claimed lives and property damage. The Meru Governor further noted that the poor working relationship between the two levels of government is partly to blame for the Tuesday Mandera attack that left 12 people dead.Munya is now calling for collaboration between national security agencies and the devolved units, saying county governments are closer to the people and were thus better positioned to have prior information on terror plots.&ldquo;If the national government agencies worked in cooperation with the counties, we would have less of these problems. County governments are closer to the people and can get access to crucial information that can be used to deal with these things before they happen.&rdquo;He continued: &ldquo;Uneasy and sometimes hostile&rdquo; relationship between national security agencies and the counties compromised the country&rsquo;s chances of sharing intelligence resulting in &ldquo;needless loss of lives and destruction of property&rdquo;.&ldquo;We are calling on the Government to reevaluate its policy on security and allow national government agencies work closely with those in the counties for purposes of synergy,&rdquo; said Munya. Speaking when he handed over the devolution torch to Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma on Thursday, Munya said sharing of intelligence would give security organs an upper hand in dealing with security threats before they escalate.&ldquo;Our hearts go out to the bereaved families and those who were injured in the attack,&rdquo; he said.
