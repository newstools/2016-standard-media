Sons of embattled Mombasa businessman Tahir Sheikh Said are embroiled in a legal battle over the control of his multi-billion-shilling empire.Each of the two sons is seeking to seize control of the transport segment of two firms, Transmara Logistic Limited and TSS Pop Service Stations, in which their father, popularly known as TSS, is the main shareholder.The two have differed on how to share the many lorries their father owns as well as other properties claimed by two companies where they are claiming shares.The tycoon&rsquo;s eldest son, Sabir Tahir Sheikh Said, has filed a counter-suit to challenge a High Court order directing him to transfer several vehicles to his younger bother, Sheikh Noorein Twahir.High Court judge Justice Njoki Mwangi issued the order after Noorein, who is a director of Transmara Logistic Limited, moved to court and successfully obtained orders forcing Sabir to release to him three 30,000-litre fuel tankers and two trailers.OVERTURN ORDER&nbsp;Mid this year, the court ordered Sabir to give Noorein part of the fleet the former had reportedly taken over.

He wants the order handing the vehicles to his younger brother reversed until the case is determined.&ldquo;I wish to put records straight and refute claims by brother that he owns three motor vehicles, two trailers and three 30,000-litre fuel tankers. He should prove he owns the property listed in this suit and prove the loss and damages he will incur if I retain them,&rdquo; said Sabir.The case between Sabir and Noorein comes at a time their father is fighting to save his other franchise, Unga Millers Limited, over a Sh2.7 billion unpaid loans from banks.On May 20, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) issued a notice to take over the management of Unga Millers Limited over Sh1 billion loan.SERVICE STATIONThe firm is currently under a new management KCB has appointed.

But Noorein has also laid claim on the firm in Nairobi.&nbsp;He accused Noorein of fraudulently transferring the vehicles belonging to the service station to his company, Transmara Logistics.Sabir also accused Noorein and Fatma of convening an illegal meeting during which the vehicles were transferred to his company.However, Noorein claims he is the real owner of the motor vehicles warning he will suffer prejudice if his brother takes them away from him.But in counter suit, Sabir&rsquo;s lawyer said his client has no intention of unlawfully repossessing any vehicles lawfully belonging to his brother.The court directed the matter be taken to the registry before the case is mentioned.
