Barclays Bank Kenya has set out to boost graduates&rsquo; preparedness for the job market.Through its ReadytoWork online platform, the lender wants to equip unemployed youth with the skills they need to improve their chances of getting a job or starting their own business. &ldquo;Despite many universities churning out huge number of graduates every year who are looking to get white-collar jobs, many do not have the skills to enable them to get these jobs,&rdquo; said Regina Gichuhi-Mwangi, Barclays Kenya&rsquo;s head of citizenship, marketing and corporate relations.The ReadytoWork portal breaks down learning material into four segments: work skills, people skills, money skills and entrepreneurial skills.Work skills provides information on writing CVs, interviewing successfully and pursuing career goals.People skills tackles developing critical communication habits and other soft skills, such as emotional intelligence.Money skills offers training on saving, creating and sticking to a budget, and accessing credit, while entrepreneurial skills advises young people on setting up a business and learning the market.The ReadytoWork curriculum is in the process of being accredited through the South African Qualifications Authority, accreditation that is recognised in Barclays&rsquo; 12 African markets.The portal&rsquo;s content is offered free of charge after interested learners register, and it targets youth aged 18 to 35. Learning is self-paced, though the portal offers suggestions on the estimated time users should spend on each topic.&ldquo;As a bank, we are committed to ensuring what we do make sense to customers, the community we operate in and our shareholders. This is why we came up with the curriculum,&rdquo; said Ms Gichuhi-Mwangi.The curriculum can be accessed through a desktop computer or mobile devices at readytowork.barclays.Learners who have gained a certain number of curriculum points can apply to work for a day at Barclays, or at its partner organisations, which include Government, corporates, small businesses and NGOs.
