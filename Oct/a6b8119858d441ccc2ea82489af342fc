He maintained that Jubilee will still clinch power in next year&rsquo;s General Election.&ldquo;The difference between us in the Jubilee Party and CORD is like day and night. The Opposition does not have a clear manifesto for Kenyans,&rdquo; said Ruto.He said Jubilee was committed to ensuring Kenyans live peacefully and the 2007/8 election violence does not happen again.&ldquo;When we took over the leadership of this country we agreed that we will ensure that Kenyans live peacefully. Politics of division does not have space in the 21 Century,&rdquo; Ruto stated.Ruto also inspected the Sigalagala-Butere Road and launched Digital Literacy Programme at the school.The Deputy President was accompanied by MPs Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Benard Shinali (Ikolomani) Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Ben Washiali (Mumias East) among others.Earlier, DP Ruto while speaking Nyahururu town, warned the Opposition to be prepared of a strong defeat in the coming General Elections.

Let them not blame anyone after the loss for they have failed to organise themselves,&rdquo; Ruto pointed out.The Deputy President castigated the Opposition saying they had no clear agenda for the country.&ldquo;Up to now,they even do not have their presidential candidate. Do you want to tell me that they can lead this country?&rdquo; he posed.He defended the move to merge small parties saying that it was for the unity of Kenyans.Free and fair nominationsThe DP pointed out that the move was meant to end the notion that parties were being formed along tribal lines.&ldquo;We are doing this not to kill democracy but to unite Kenyans.This is the only way that we can push the country forward, &ldquo; he said.He said Jubilee was open to everyone seeking election insisting that the party does not have favourite candidates.The DP said: &ldquo;The only vote I am asking for is that of President Uhuru Kenyatta.&rdquo;Mr Ruto said the Government has set aside Sh7.5billion for the construction of roads in Nyahururu and another Sh400million to connect Nyahururu residents to power under the Last Mile Project.He said Sh780 million will be spent to expand Nyahururu and Nanyuki hospitals to referral status with cancer, dialysis and intensive care units facilities.The DP was accompanied by Laikipia Governor Joshua Irungu, Laikipia West MP Wachira Karani and MPs David Kiaraho (Ol Kalou), Waweru Ndiritu (Ndaragwa), Laikipia woman representative Jane Apollo and Kipipiri Member of Parliament Samuel Gichigi.The leaders all endorsed him to run for presidency come 2022 General Elections.Mr Gichigi said Jubilee supporters were working round the clock to popularise the party in the region.Kiaraho said Nyandarua and Laikipia Counties have immensely benefited from Government developments projects citing hospitals, electricity, dams and roads and therefore they have every reason to back Jubilee Government as it seeks a reelection next year.&ldquo;CORD leaders are just a bunch of characters with no clear agenda for this country, all what they look for is negativity,&rdquo; he claimed.Mr Kairaho told off the Opposition over their claims that Government was only issuing National Identification cards to Jubilee strongholds while sidelining CORD areas.Ms Apollos commended the Government for increasing funds for Women Representatives thereby boosting their capacity to participate in development of their counties.She said women representatives are now in a position to fund development projects and have a positive impact in the lives of their constituents.In Kakamega, the DP and his entourage raised more than Sh9 million for the construction of the school&rsquo;s dormitory.The DP said he and President Uhuru Kenyatta contributed a total of Sh5 million.
