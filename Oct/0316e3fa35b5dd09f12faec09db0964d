&nbsp;Residents are asking the area National Environment Management Authority (Nema) to act on farmers who have encroached on a swamp. Villagers in Kaplolo, Keiyo South sub-county, said despite numerous trips to the environment and county authorities, nothing had been done to save the wetland from depletion.Joseph Kolobech, one of the residents, said acres of the swamp that lies near Kipkabus Dam had been steadily depleted.&quot;The swamp has been left bare and it is commonplace to find people ploughing there,&quot; he said.Nema officials confirmed that the swamp has been turned into farmland and promised to act as soon as the county government finished mapping all wetlands.
