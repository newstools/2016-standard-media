Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has disowned Jubilee and declared that his administration is now under his Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party.&quot;I am leading a CCM administration, not a Jubilee one anymore. Let it be known because I have since decamped officially to the new party,&quot; declared the governor at Bomet Green Stadium during Mashujaa Day celebrations.He said his administration changed to CCM following the winding up of the United Republican Party (URP), whose ticket he rode into office in 2013. &quot;It is official, I am a governor representing the CCM party. All the county government employees are working for a CCM government. When we talk about Mashinani we are not politicking, it is provided for by the Constitution,&quot; Ruto told County Commissioner Bernard Leparmarai and other national government officials.&quot;Our rights to belong to different political parties has been recognised by the Constitution and that is why I have opposed any move, however, subtle to turn Kenya into a single party state,&quot; he said.Ruto said CCM will engage in talks with Jubilee and CORD ahead of the 2017 elections and called on residents to allow politicians from all parties to campaign freely.The governor has opposed the Jubilee merger saying it was against the spirit of multi-partism.The move has put him in constant collision with Deputy President William Ruto, who is pushing to have the Rift Valley region in Jubilee ahead of next year&#39;s polls.But Ruto has stuck to his guns, saying he was exercising his democratic right and would not be forced to abandon his course.During the event, the governor also called for the recognition of World War veterans and those who fought for multiparty democracy and new constitution.Leparmarai called for tolerance among the various political divides in the county and warned against hooliganism.
