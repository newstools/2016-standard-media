&ldquo;Achievement brings its own anti-climax,&rdquo; Maya Angelou &ndash; American poet, memoirist, and civil rights activist once said.This phrase perfectly captures the inactivity and confusion surrounding President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party, only a month after it was launched in a historic and pulsating jamboree. Jubilee Party&rsquo;s inaugural delegates&rsquo; conference stayed true to a well-managed display of power, organisational capacity, money and political might.The three days of pomp and colour and the meticulous organisation of the events in which 13 political parties melted into the Jubilee Party fade in light of the new party&rsquo;s current reality.A number of visits by The Standard on Saturday to the Jubilee Party offices early in the week, revealed that in the glass covered beautiful building emblazoned with the heraldic symbol of President Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto holding hands, only one staff member runs the show.&ldquo;She is the only one here, when she leaves, no one is left,&rdquo; said one of the construction workers partitioning floors of the building.The eight-storeyed magnificent JP headquarters on Murang&rsquo;a Road in Nairobi was unveiled by the President at the height of the ecstatic JP launch.At the parking bay that once bore the weight of tens of branded 4x4 top of the range vehicles, only a single car is almost permanently parked there.Turned awayApart from the three or four workers partitioning floors of the building, little activity is visible at the &lsquo;biggest party&rdquo; headquarters in the country.At the entrance of the JP headquarters, youths escorting one of their own aspiring to be an MCA in Kiambu County, is turned away by security guards because &ldquo;there is no one to address you.&rdquo;And in counties across the country where Jubilee enjoys solid support, members are running amok politically as they elbow each other to open rival offices a few metres from each other.The party has slowly become the antithesis of the success story that its supporters were sold to in political rallies.Jubilee Party interim Vice chairman David Murathe said that they had decided to go slow on the political activity in the party so that they would not raise political temperatures in the country.&ldquo;After we launched, we decided to play down politics because we are the party of the government. We do not want to excite political activity in the country, we know the opportune time when we can hit the road running. Otherwise we still have out teams together. For example, Kiraitu inherited the role of former minister Njenga Karume in mobilisation within Mt Kenya. He may not be an official of the party but he is a very key member. You can see how he managed the merger together with others and we shall be forever grateful to his team that he co-chaired with Noah Wekesa,&rdquo; said Mr Murathe.DemandsBut notably, the vacuum in the leadership at the national and county levels for the president&rsquo;s party could easily have brought more harm than good in the political vehicle that Kenyatta and Ruto will use in the August 2017 General Election.Elected leaders and aspirants in Mt Kenya and Rift Valley have taken advantage of the confusion in the party to open offices in their counties and install themselves and their supporters as party officials.Competition for party leadership positions is stiff in Murang&rsquo;a, Kirinyaga, Nakuru, Nyeri, Tharaka Nithi, Nyandarua and Embu.As a result a group of former parties calling themselves T-9 has emerged with demands for top-level meeting to ensure smooth running of the party.The T9 group led by Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka and former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile cancelled a scheduled press conference on party matters on Wednesday.They had listed those to address the conference as Lusaka, Kalembe Ndile, Albert Nyaundi, John Kamama and Ben Washiali among other former party officials.In an interview with The Standard on Saturday, Mr Kalembe said the press conference was supposed to communicate to the President and his deputy that the group need proper consultations before unveiling of party officials.&ldquo;We want to tell the President and his deputy that they should consult extensively before they arrive at the list of those to run the national office. We are opposed to a situation where names will just be read without our knowledge,&rdquo; he said.He said the party would run smoothly without issues if they were consulted.&ldquo;We want things to run smoothly and we contributed two-thirds of the delegates and engaged in the building of the party leadership, we gave Kenyatta our parties in good faith and without conditions and all we are asking for is to be consulted in naming of the officials,&rdquo; said the former MP.He explained that they were also concerned that there was inactivity in the party and their former party members were raising concerns that Jubilee Party was becoming moribund.&ldquo;Since we left Kasarani, we have not heard anything and our supporters are becoming restless and wondering why they dissolved their parties just to be inactive. Our members want direction,&rdquo; said Kalembe.He also said pay for the delegates was one of the thorny issues that they wanted to raise at the press conference.But Murathe disclosed that the party will from next week engage the former parties&rsquo; Executive directors to start planning the operations of Jubilee Party including how the party will roll out its membership recruitment drive.&ldquo;We are in the process of bringing together the secretariat teams to beef up the party and strategise on activities across the country,&rdquo; he said.He said once the president and his deputy unveil the list of the officials it will be all systems go.Senator Kiraitu Murungi who jetted back in the country after leading a delegation of party officials for a benchmarking visit to the Communist Party of China played down the lack of activity in the party, saying that they would address the issue soon.&ldquo;The party is stable and we are only waiting for the President and his deputy for their direction before we move forward,&rdquo; said Kiraitu.
