Activist Boniface Mwangi has threatened to move to court to compel Deputy President William Ruto to declare his wealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mwangi through lawyer Gitobu Imanyara said that if the Kenya Revenue Authority and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission fail to disclose Ruto&#39;s wealth by close of business today, they will have no choice but to seek the court&#39;s intervention.&quot;We have not received any feedback to our demand and if the period we gave them elapses, we will move to court next week seeking orders to compel KRA and IEBC to disclose Ruto&#39;s wealth,&quot; said Mr Imanyara. The lawyer on Monday wrote to the State entities demanding that he be supplied with Ruto&#39;s wealth declaration forms from 2013 when he was elected the deputy President.He said they want the documents to form part of their client&#39;s defence in a case in which the DP has sued him for defamation for linking him to the death of businessman Jacob Juma.Ruto&#39;s lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, however, said they are not concerned with Mwangi&#39;s demand for the wealth declaration forms since they had not formally made the request in court.&quot;The demand for the wealth declaration forms was not to us but to KRA and IEBC,&quot; he said.
