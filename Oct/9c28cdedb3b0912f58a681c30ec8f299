Deputy President William Ruto toured West Pokot County yesterday and criticised political parties that have refused to join the new Jubilee Party.Ruto vowed to ensure the region, which is a Kanu stronghold, supports Jubilee Party during the next elections.Speaking at Kokwotendo Mixed Secondary School during a funds drive, he predicted that the 2017 General Election would be a two-horse race between Jubilee and CORD. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be convinced by cheap politics, avoid other parties that have no direction. If they are neither in Jubilee nor CORD it means they are confused,&rdquo; he said.Ruto, who toured Pokot Central and Pokot North sub counties, said the Jubilee government had transformed West Pokot County in the last three years.DevelopmentHe noted that Jubilee had identified its presidential flag bearers for the 2017 and 2022 polls and would defeat its rivals.&ldquo;We are determined to improve West Pokot County so vote wisely if you want politics of development,&rdquo; he added.He said the party was ready to face its opponents and said the government&rsquo;s development record would give Jubilee an edge.&ldquo;Last year, we purchased health equipment worth Sh450 million for West Pokot County. We have set aside Sh4.5 billion every year to boost the health sector in the country,&rdquo; he added.Governor Simon Kachapin also drummed up support for Jubilee and assured the DP of support in his 2022 presidential bid.&ldquo;My county will vote for you to be our next president come 2022, our county was marginalised but the Jubilee government has brought total transformation to the remote parts of this county,&rdquo; said Mr Kachapin.The governor said he was ready to battle it out with his opponents for the gubernatorial seat, and noted that he would use his development record to win support.&ldquo;People are tired of propaganda. We are in the era where people want development to the grassroots level&rdquo; he said.Other leaders who accompanied the DP were Pokot Central MP Philip Rotino, Women Representative Regina Nyeris and Principal&nbsp; Secretary Correctional Services Michah Powon.
