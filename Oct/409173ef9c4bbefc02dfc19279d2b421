Nairobi Jubilee-allied MCAs have now called on former Gathanga MP Peter Kenneth to run for city governor.They, however, want him to dissolve his National Congress Party and join the newly formed Jubilee Party.&quot;We would like to welcome Peter Kenneth to vie for Nairobi&#39;s top most seat because his track record has proven that he can run Nairobi and solve its issues,&quot; said Ngara MCA Chege Mwaura. Last week, the 2013 presidential aspirant dropped his 2017 bid and announced that he would be vying for a gubernatorial seat and back President Uhuru Kenyatta in his re-election bid.Mr Kenneth, however, declined to state which county he would be vying in, saying he was still consulting on whether to run in Nairobi, Nakuru or Murang&#39;a.Addressing the Press yesterday in Nairobi, Deputy Minority Leader Chege Ngaruiya urged Kenneth to dissolve his party as a show of his full support for President Kenyatta.&quot;Just like the other contestants from Jubilee who have shown interest in the position, there is so much he can do for Nairobi people thus we are welcoming him to vie in the city. Every aspirant from Jubilee brings a lot to the table and we want to ensure a clean victory come 2017,&quot; said Mr Ngaruiya.
