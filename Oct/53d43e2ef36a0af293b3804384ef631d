&nbsp;Murang&rsquo;a: Police officers have pointed out bottlenecks in signing up for a new medical insurance plan for the service. It has emerged that some officers are yet to be migrated to the improved scheme, almost three weeks after they were required to do so.The National Police Service in a communication dated September 20 had directed all police and prison officers to sign up for the new comprehensive scheme that is being provided by AAR as the lead insurer and four other companies by October 1.It has, however, emerged that some officers are still registered with their old insurer - the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) - and have, therefore, had to foot their own medical bills and those of their family members.&quot;I was really frustrated when my card was rejected, but I was able to convince the medical officers that I would raise the amount on my medical bill once I was discharged,&quot; said one officer.Ministry of Interior and National Coordination spokesman Mwenda Njoka confirmed there were teething problems in the roll-out of the new scheme, with some officers unable to access services.&quot;We are aware of the challenges. They are being rectified to ensure the officers get quality medical care,&quot; said Mr Njoka.Senior officers said they had communicated the challenges to police headquarters.Among the benefits of the new medical scheme is that unlike the old one, officers can seek treatment from any hospital within the country including top private hospitals.Under the old cover, officers from the rank of Constable to Senior Assistant Inspector-General were limited to selected health facilities.
