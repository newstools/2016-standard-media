&nbsp; Investors have expressed worry over a marginal rise in international arrivals at the Coast. Reacting to a report issued by the country&#39;s top tourism marketer, Kenya Tourism Board (KTB), international arrivals for January to August 2016 by air and sea closed at 581,808 compared to 496,576 in 2015, illustrating an increase of 17.2 per cent. Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers Coast branch Executive Officer Sam Ikwaye said the latest statistics demonstrate that the country is yet to achieve substantial recovery to reflect Kenya&#39;s best reference year of 2011. &quot;From the KTB statistics, this shows short-term (year on year) and long-term (base year) comparisons that indicate that yes, we have grown +17 per cent but we are overall still down at 50 per cent compared to the industry&#39;s better years,&quot; Mr Ikwaye said. He said the figures were worrying most investors, especially in the Coast region.

He said smaller airlines have not succeeded in filling the gap in passenger airlifts to the coastal tourism hub of Malindi. Ikwaye added the situation was worse, especially for the few visitors who have challenges using local carriers. Arrivals at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport grew by 16.5 per cent to 522,709 compared to 448,549 in 2015. And at the Moi International Airport, 57,219 visitors arrived this year compared to 48,031 in 2015, a 19.1 per cent growth. There were 1,880 cruise ship passenger arrivals recorded until August 2016. Uganda remains top as Africa&#39;s largest supplier of tourists to Kenya, with 9,771 arrivals. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
