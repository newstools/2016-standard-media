Billionaire Paul Wanderi Ndung&rsquo;u of betting firm Sportpesa is among owners of the firms associated with the controversial payments worth Sh5.3 billion from Afya House.Ownership details of the companies that benefited from the free maternity kitty revealed by the State Law office list Mr Wanderi and Richard Ngatia, the owner of a high-end nightclub in Nairobi, as directors of Life Care Medics.Ambrose Makanga Ngari, a former banker, and Esther Wahito Makanga are the equal-share owners of Estama Investments &ndash; the firm paid the highest amount worth over Sh1 billion. The directors of Medafrica Limited have been identified as Njage Makanga and Naomi Wanjiku.Estama Investments has never filed any returns since incorporation in June 2008, which should effectively lock it out of all public procurement as tax compliance is a prerequisite for government tendering. &ldquo;The records, both physical and digital of the three companies are available at the Companies Registry,&rdquo; read a statement from the State Law Office, which contradicts prior findings.Disclosure information of three firms which were sampled to unveil the beneficial owners, could be a major development even as the probe on what could be yet another scandal of the Jubilee administration, gets under way.&ldquo;According to the records, no annual returns have been filed since incorporation. It is a private company limited by shares that was incorporated on June 19, 2008,&rdquo; the registry said of Estama Investments.How the firm qualified for the award of the controversial tender and an upfront payments of Sh200 million on the same day a purchase order was raised could point to possible insider collusion.Mr Wanderi, who is linked to tens of companies including motor dealer CMC Holdings at the height of its boardroom controversy, told The Standard on Saturday that this was a clean business deal.&ldquo;We were contracted as suppliers by the Health Ministry in a tender where our company delivered food supplements, paid taxes on them to the KRA and delivered the goods for storage at Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa),&rdquo; Mr Wanderi said in an interview yesterday.He added that the supposed delivery was made to Kemsa because the goods required to be refrigerated, equipment which the Health Ministry did not have.His partner, Mr Ngatia promised to send a comprehensive statement on the tender as the chief executive of Life Care Medics.Medafrica, which we selected at random for search at the companies&rsquo; registry, is owned by the same director as Estama &ndash; contracted to supply 100 portable medical clinics.Njage Makanga, listed as a co-owner of Medafrica, yesterday said in a statement that he acquired Estama Investments in January 2015 from his uncle Ambrose Makanga and Esther Makanga.&ldquo;I wish to clarify that I purchased one thousand (1000) shares for valuable consideration in the capital of ESTAMA INVESTMENTS LIMITED pursuant to a written Sale Agreement dated January 28, 2015 from the then shareh olders AMBROSE MAKANGA NGARI and ESTHER WAHITO MAKANGA and that the Vendors of those shares are no longer shareholders or directors of that company since the said sale of their shares to myself. I therefore confirm that the said AMBROSE MAKANGA NGARI and ESTHER WAHITO MAKANGA no longer have any legal or beneficial interest in the company since the 28th January 2015,&rdquo; the statement read in part.&ldquo;I want to state very clearly that the contract awarded to my firm was fulfilled to the expectations according to the contractual agreements. I also paid the relevant taxes in that regard. The documents or any other detail of this contract are available for inspection,&rdquo; said Makanga&ldquo;I also wish to categorically state that all the company&rsquo;s dealings with the Ministry of Health since I acquired the shares have been above board and the alleged &lsquo;scam&rsquo; cited by your reporter and editors is a figment of their fertile imagination without any iota of truth,&rdquo; Makanga said in a statement.Cooperative Bank of Kenya which was also found to have been paid more than Sh265 million, yesterday said the transaction related to letters of credit granted to the ministry.According to Ngumo Kahiga, the head of Marketing at the bank, the payment was in respect of two letters of credit, established on a customer&rsquo;s bank account in the ordinary course of our business.&ldquo;The commodities were delivered to Kemsa,&rdquo; Mr Kahiga said.
