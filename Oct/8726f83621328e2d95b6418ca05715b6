The rival coalitions clashed yesterday&nbsp;after Opposition leader Raila&nbsp;Odinga&rsquo;s allies made fresh demands&nbsp;on electoral reforms.Twin demands by CORD MPs for&nbsp;a fresh voter registration and halting&nbsp;of procurement processes until&nbsp;new electoral commissioners assume&nbsp;office ignited a fresh battle&nbsp;with Jubilee leaders.ODM chairman John Mbadi declared&nbsp;the party was no longer interested&nbsp;in an audit of a register of&nbsp;voters and instead wants fresh voter&nbsp;registration. National Assembly Majority&nbsp;Leader Aden Duale accused the&nbsp;Opposition of reopening issues settled&nbsp;by a bi-partisan parliamentary&nbsp;committee.Another political battle looms after allies of Opposition leader Raila Odinga made fresh demands on electoral reforms.ODM yesterday swung around and demanded that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) lists voters afresh instead of auditing the register of voters as recommended by the joint select committee on electoral reforms.And Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) affiliate parties also issued a warning against IEBC procuring polls kits until a new team of commissioners takes charge.CORD claims allowing IEBC to carry on with procurement when the beleaguered nine commissioners are still in office may compromise the August 8, 2017, polls.But the Jubilee coalition accused the Opposition of trying to reopen debate on issues that had been settled by a bipartisan committee that was co-chaired by senators Kiraitu Murungi and James Orengo, formed after the bloody anti-IEBC protests.Set deadlinesThe governing coalition insisted that procurement functions belong to the secretariat, which should move on with its plans to beat some of the set deadlines.ODM Chairman John Mbadi said the party was no longer interested in the audit of the voter register but was now demanding fresh voter registration in the months of February and March before inspection of register in April.&quot;The audit of the register is a waste of time. It was an insertion in the law that does not make sense. As ODM, we want people to be registered afresh. Two months is sufficient to register people,&quot; said Mr Mbadi.Mbadi, Wiper Secretary General and Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, ODM Director of Political Affairs Opiyo Wandayi and Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr said procurement of electoral equipment should only be done once the new commissioners take charge.But National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale accused the Opposition of dishonesty, saying CORD was part of the joint select team that made the recommendations, including the need to audit the register.Mr Duale maintained the commission must continue with its activities to ensure enough preparations for credible polls.&quot;This kind of stance may jeopardise the electoral process. What if Parliament rejects names of the commissioners? You cannot shift the goal post every now and then,&quot; Duale said.Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria added: &quot;The country went through the work of the committee co-chaired by Orengo and Kiraitu that concluded there was no need for a fresh voter register. If the Opposition don&#39;t want an election, that&#39;s their problem.&quot;Kuria explained a technical committee that includes representatives of political parties is steering procurement of poll equipment.The Opposition leaders said 2013 polls were partly bungled because of mismanagement of the procurement process, insisting they would not allow another monkey business in the process.&quot;The electoral reforms must be done by the new commission so that they take responsibility. This caretaker committee should not transact any business because their stay in office will only interfere with electoral processes,&quot; said Mbadi.Duale said part of the agreement was that the Issack Hassan-led team will remain in office until a new commission is instituted.&quot;As we speak now, the commission is putting all in place and we will ask IEBC soon to give Parliamentary Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) updates because everything must be in place for credible polls,&quot; he said.Major hurdleIEBC is already staring at major timelines hurdle and there are already talks that it may be forced to procure equipment directly, something that contributed to the bungling of 2013 General Election.Yesterday, IEBC selection panel called for applications for the position of a chairman and six commissioners.According to the Bernadette Musudi-led team, they will receive applications for two weeks, before shortlisting begins on or about November 15.The public will have a week to give views on suitability of the applicants. And interviews for qualified candidates will be conducted between November 22 to 26, with dates expected to vary depending on the number of applications received and number of persons short-listed.Based on its plans, IEBC will have a new set of commissioners to replace Issack Hassan team by second week of December.Mr Omar said people seeking to replace the outgoing team must be ready to work round the clock to deliver credible polls for Kenyans.He said it would require Parliament to intervene to review some of the timelines set by the joint team.
