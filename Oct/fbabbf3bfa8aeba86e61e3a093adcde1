Mr Laibuta&#39;s house is said to have been broken into on the night of Mashujaa Day and the suspects made away with his laptop.The laptop is said to contain crucial defence evidence in a defamation case lodged by Deputy President William Ruto.Mr Mwangi&#39;s lead lawyer Gitobu Imanyara confirmed the break-in, saying nothing else was stolen.The case was reported at Thindingua police base on October 21.Speaking to The Standard, the police boss said investigations on the said burglary are ongoing.He, however, said police are yet to know exactly what time the burglary took place.&quot;We hope to make progress soon. But we do not know exactly the time it happened,&quot; he said.The burglary on Mr Mwangi&#39;s lawyer&#39;s home has been parallel to claims from Mr Imanyara that some individuals have also been trying to hack his email accounts to solicit money from his well-to-do colleagues.In the case where Imanyara is representing Mwangi, the latter is accused of defaming the DP following tweets he posted on social media. Mr Mwangi has since refused to delete the tweets as demanded by Mr Ruto.
