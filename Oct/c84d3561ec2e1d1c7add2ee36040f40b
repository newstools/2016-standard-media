MOMBASA, KENYA: The Institute of Public Accountants (ICPAK) has backed calls for the resignation or removal of Kenya Airways top officials saying the changes would instill customer confidence in the national carrier.The accountants&#39; professional body said although the top officials were not to blame for the current crisis facing KQ, there was need for changes to infuse stability for its recovery.&quot;KQ woos are pegged on its past business model which failed even though the drafters had good intentions. The jet fuel hedging decision was a good one then but it failed and cannot be blamed on the current top managers,&quot; said ICPAK Vice Chairman Julius Mwatu. He added; &quot;but as an institution we think it is always better to have a new blood although we are not sure that change in top managers only can turn around the national carrier.&quot;On Tuesday, KQ pilots issued a seven-day strike notice if the airline&#39;s chief executive officer Mbuvi Ngunze and Chairman Ambassador Denis Awori doesn&rsquo;t resign for alleged mismanagement.The Kenya Airline Pilots Association (KALPA) said its 450 pilots will go on strike starting October 18 a move that could cripple the airline&#39;s operation.ICPAK said the government as one of the shareholder in KQ should not only think of bailing out the airline but also be active in stream lining management of the national carrier.Accounts are in meeting in Mombasa&#39;s White Sands Hotel for a four-day second public sector audit conference where they also rooted for accountants to join politics in the next election. &nbsp;
