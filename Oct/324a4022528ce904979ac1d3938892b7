State House has taken charge of an online drive to refute claims of a Sh5 billion scandal at the Health ministry.As Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu was giving an update of the matter yesterday, State House Digital Director Dennis Itumbi was busy streaming the CS&#39;s brief live on social media.And immediately he (Dr Mailu) was done, Mr Itumbi&#39;s social media page was splashed with a summary of the update and a sneak peek into what should be expected today on the saga. &quot;Tomorrow, the Powerpoint presentation complete with vouchers, tax certificates, and video evidence of each issue. It will be live here from 3pm tomorrow (today),&quot; read a post on his Facebook page.This was posted at 4.23pm, barely 10 minutes after Mailu&#39;s address.It went on to highlight a summary of what the CS&#39;s address was all about and even opened the forum for questions which are to be answered today.Itumbi was the first to post on his social media page the upcoming press briefing by the Health boss alerting all media: &quot;Ministry of Health Press Conference at 2.30pm (3hrs).&quot;In a post uploaded at around 1am yesterday accompanied by screenshots of the said draft audit report, Itumbi seemed to lash out at individuals blindly following narratives being spread about grand corruption in Jubilee.&quot;Interesting. We have been commenting about an audit report we have not seen or even read. Okay, page one of audit report admits three main things - one was disclosed by those who read for you. The other two were hidden so as to create a narrative of grand corruption,&quot; read the post.It added: &quot;It is an interim audit report. It is &quot;AN ON-GOING PROCESS...&quot; - Of course that could not be pointed out in the search of an exclusive and Grand Scandal story.&quot;This was the same message passed on October 28, which read: &quot;How many of us have seen and read the interim audit report? Or are we all commenting about something we have not even seen? Ama tulisomewa (Or someone read it for us)?&quot;Under the hashtag #TheFactsKE, Itumbi has even been &#39;educating&#39; Kenyans on how an audit report is conducted.
