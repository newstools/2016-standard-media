Eight MPs have challenged Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join the Jubilee government.At a public function in Machakos yesterday attended by Deputy President William Ruto, the lawmakers said Kalonzo does not stand a chance of becoming CORD&rsquo;s presidential candidate. The eight included five from Ukambani who recently ditched their parties for Jubilee. Kalonzo, ODM leader Raila Odinga and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula will be fighting it out to fly CORD&rsquo;s flag in next year&rsquo;s elections.The MPs claimed that Kalonzo will be shortchanged, and as such they implored him to rally the region behind the ruling coalition.Ruto did not directly respond to calls by the MPs for Kalonzo to join the newly formed Jubilee Party but instead said the Jubilee government was ready to serve all Kenyans equally irrespective of their political inclinations.MoU UNTENABLENairobi Senator Mike Sonko and MPs Victor Munyaka (Machakos Town), Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni), Vincent Musyoka (Mwala), Itwiku Mbai (Masinga), Regina Ndambuki (Kilome), Kanini Kega (Kieni) and Moses Kuria (Gatundu South) all called on Kalonzo to dump Raila&rsquo;s team and back the Government.&ldquo;Kalonzo had an MoU with Raila to support him (Kalonzo) for the presidency but Raila has declared that he will again contest,&rdquo; said Mr Mbai.Mr Kisoi said: &ldquo;Raila and Kalonzo&rsquo;s MoU is untenable and it&rsquo;s time the community read the signs and took the right political direction. 2017 elections will be a defining moment as to whether the Kamba will be permanent in Government, or permanently in the Opposition.&rdquo;Mr Musyoka claimed that Raila was reluctant to support Kalonzo to fly CORD&rsquo;s ticket.&ldquo;Kambas must get prepared to be in the next government. Our people must not line up to vote and find themselves in the losing side once again,&rdquo; Mr Munyaka added.Mr Kuria alleged that the Jubilee government had given Kalonzo a good offer to take a third of the Government positions but he declined. &ldquo;If he took the offer, Kambas would not be languishing in the Opposition like they are today,&rdquo; he said.Mr Kega said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to be in Government than Opposition. I beseech the Kamba nation to be cautious this time round and join the Government. Kalonzo should join us in JP as we are ready to work with him.&rdquo;The local MPs defended their decision to join JP and urged the community to support President Kenyatta&rsquo;s re-election bid.&ldquo;The Kamba will not again accept to sink into political oblivion, and we are urging the locals to vote wisely come next year,&rdquo; said Dr Munyaka.Musyoka claimed the Opposition was on the verge of disintegration. &ldquo;Let us support the sitting government because a divided Opposition cannot defeat a united government,&rdquo; said Musyoka.Ruto did not dwell on the issue only saying the newly formed Jubilee Party was keen on ensuring equitable distribution of the national cake irrespective of&nbsp; political inclinations.&ldquo;As a Government, we are committed to ensure no region is left behind in the ongoing efforts to transform the living standards of all Kenyans no matter their tribe, religion, or other political inclination,&rdquo; Ruto said at Lilongwe grounds in Mutituni where he attended a Sunday Mass and later led a funds drive in aid of Mutituni Catholic Church.He said the region had reaped numerous benefits in terms of development projects from the Government.&ldquo;This coming Mashujaa Day, the President and I will be in Machakos to lead the celebrations and officially announce the commissioning of a dual carriage way from Athi River-Machakos-Konza City,&rdquo; he said.The DP challenged the Opposition to quit divisive politics and calls for mass protests that may stoke anarchy.He said hate-driven politics have no place in the 21st century.
