At least 300 Kenyans have been killed in terror-related cases in the past three years, a humans right body has said.Kwale County is among counties most affected by terrorism due to the presence of a big number of suspects linked to Al Shabaab returning from military training in Mombasa. This was revealed in a joint report by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa).The two agencies disclosed this on Saturday at a forum in Kwale where the rights group has launched an inquest into rights violations. KNCHR vice chairperson George Morara said the killings were perpetrated by police or returnees.&quot;We have lost 300 Kenyans in the past three years largely due to insecurity. This is not good news as we approach elections. We hope that as we approach next year&#39;s elections, there will be measures in place to make sure we do not lose more people,&quot; he said.&nbsp;INTELLIGENCE GATHERINGHe said police should take their work more seriously so that there is intelligence gathering since a number of cases have been reported but no conclusion has been reached.&quot;What is emerging is that the rampant killings are perpetrated by police or those that the public suspect to be returnees who refuse to be integrated,&quot; he said.Tom Kagwe, a commissioner at Ipoa, accused the National Police Service of being stuck in the past by policing the public and calling them to be part of a broader strategy to fight terror.&quot;Police need to up their game; they cannot continue suspecting everyone but need to work within the law. Community policing committees are not working due to lack of trust between police and public,&quot; he said.Matuga OCPD Patrick Oduma, who appeared before the inquest, said there is no co-operation between police and wananchi largely because of fear caused by continuous killings in the area.
