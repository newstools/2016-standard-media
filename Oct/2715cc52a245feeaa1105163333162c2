She is an invaluable asset to the government of Kenya but because we believe in a bigger agenda, we think she can do better for Africa.&rdquo;He observed that the support of African countries had seen Kenya successfully host a number of international meetings in Nairobi most of which had changed the narrative that Africa is a continent of conflicts, disease and poverty.&nbsp;He extolled the virtues of Ms Amina saying she was among the architects of the continental economic blue print agenda 2063 that required someone with diplomatic knowhow at the apex of the body to galvanize and drive the progress of the continent like her.The Deputy President said Africa needed to take her rightful place in the community of nations noting that the continent needs someone who spearhead reforms in the continental body and at the United Nations.He said:&nbsp; &ldquo;53% of decisions at the United Nations are about Africa and yet Africa has no place where decisions about her are being made. We need reforms at the UN so that Africa can be in the decision making organ of the UN.&rdquo;Mr. Ruto emphasized that integration of the continent in terms of trade and investment was critical because intra-Africa trade was only at 13% compared that of Europe at 50 % and Asia 40%.&ldquo;We need to trade more with ourselves and invest more to create prosperity on the continent,&rdquo; he added.The Vice chairperson of the AUC Erastus Mwencha expressed confidence that Ms Amina possessed qualities that will enhance integration on the continent and in particular save the Tripartite Free Trade Area.Ms Amina acknowledged that the position came with a lot of responsibilities but hastened to add that with the support of other African countries and through her, the continental body would realize her dreams.
