A woman has sued the Attorney General, the county government and a nurse at Likoni Sub-District Hospital for negligence and misdiagnosis that led to the amputation of her son&#39;s right arm.Christine Nthoki, mother of the four-year-old child whose hand was amputated after being put in a plaster cast, said the AG and the county government failed to employ competent medical, clinical and nursing staff during her son&#39;s hospitalisation.In papers filed in a Mombasa court yesterday, Ms Nthoki submitted that the three healthcare givers administered medical treatment that fell below the reasonable standards of care required of a competent healthy facility. She said a physiotherapy nurse, Hyline Memba, who examined the baby failed to properly examine and diagnose the extent of the injury, and also failed to refer the X-ray to a competent radiologist for a report.The mother, who was being cross-examined by both the defence and plaintiff lawyers before Chief Magistrate Julius Nang&#39;ea, said the nurse should have referred her son to a competent medical practitioner and paid more attention to her son&#39;s hand.She blamed the nurse for a wrong diagnosis that indicated that her son had a crack in the right arm, which prompted her to plaster the arm in an unprofessional manner that led to the amputation.&quot;My son was right-handed, now he is struggling to use his left arm. Although he has healed, I still blame the nurse who told me that my son was hurt and proceeded to plaster him, which contributed to the amputation,&quot; she told the court.Her lawyer, Jane Umara, said the AG and county government were responsible for the administration, management, staffing, provision material, surgical, nursing and anciliary services at the hospital.&quot;The X-ray at Peponi X-Ray Centre showed no fracture on the minor&#39;s limb, the application of the plaster at Likoni Sub-District Hospital was based on a misdiagnosis of fracture not demonstrated on the X-ray availed, and as a result of the negligence and misdiagnosis, the minor lost his arm, suffered injury, loss and damage,&quot; said Ms Umara.A medical report from Peter Ummar, a private practising radiologist, said that an amputation could have been avoided if the minor had not been plastered.
