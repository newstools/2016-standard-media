A majority of youth in informal settlements believe they should start having sex at the age of between 16 and 20.This is according to a newly-released survey by Pan African Research Services Ltd which was conducted in 12 slums in Nakuru, Machakos, Kisumu, Makueni and Uasin Gishu counties.Some 46 per cent of those polled felt that sex at that age was appropriate. The researchers, led by Pars Research Associate Director Susan Chege, have now urged the government to develop campaigns to discourage early sex among youths.The poll, in which 390 respondents were interviewed, was conducted in Kibera, Mathare and Mukuru slums in Nairobi; Langas and Munyaka in Uasin Gishu; Nunguni and Wote in Makueni; and Nyalenda and Abunga in Kisumu.
