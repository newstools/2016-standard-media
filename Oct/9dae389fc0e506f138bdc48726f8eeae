Two Jubilee MPs yesterday dismissed claims of disunity among members in the party&#39;s 2017 Nairobi governorship race.The MPs, Dennis Waweru (Dagoretti) and David Kiaraho (Olkalou), termed the competition between them &#39;friendly matches&#39;, saying they were ready to work together to unseat Governor Evans Kidero.&quot;We have one team called Jubilee and we are a united front. What you are seeing now are just friendly matches. We are ready to support whoever is going to be nominated to be the flag bearer,&quot; said Waweru. Speaking during a fundraiser at the ACK St Timothy Church in Kagira yesterday, Waweru denied claims that Jubilee politicians were ganging up to vote for either Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa or Senator Mike Sonko, leaving him out in the cold.&quot;I do not belong to any camp within Jubilee and people should stop dividing us.The President and his deputy have guaranteed us that there will be free and fair elections conducted by preferably the electoral body and we will endorse whoever is nominated,&quot; he said.Mr Waweru hit out at Suna East MP Junet Mohammed for claiming that central region was being favoured in voter registration and issuance of National Identity cards.He blamed the Opposition for trying to turn the country against the Jubilee government, saying CORD was fond of inciting the public.&quot;CORD should stop shifting their goalposts. They claimed that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) would hamper free and fair elections in 2017 so we sent the commissioners home.Now they are raising issues with the secretariat and voter registration. They should stop attacking the commission because the citizens are the ones to vote,&quot; headed.Kiaraho lauded Waweru&#39;s sentiments, saying registration was a right and not a favour.&quot;Every year the Opposition comes up with issues in order to blind voters. They are trying to justify their defeat ahead of polls,&quot; said Mr Kiaraho.&nbsp;&nbsp;
