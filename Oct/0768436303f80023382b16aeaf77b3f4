A police officer&#39;s former girlfriend wants him to pay more than three quarters of his salary to maintain a child born three months after they separated. Halima Arif wants the court to order Almas Said Mangi to pay her Sh15,000 for food and Sh3,000 for medical and other expenses per month to maintain a boy she claims he sired nine years ago. The money she is demanding comes to about Sh18,433. But Mangi, who says he earns Sh23,364 per month, denies being the boy&#39;s biological father, saying he last saw the child one month after birth. He says requests to Halima to accompany him to hospital for a DNA test to establish if the child is his have been turned down. But Halima says the DNA test has already been done, and the results indicate the child is Mangi&#39;s. The officet pleaded that attaching his salary would drive him into debt.

DNA TEST Mangi accuses Halima of not honouring scheduled meetings for a DNA test. &quot;Despite travelling from Nairobi on several occasions and offering to foot the bill of the DNA test, Halima has refused to accompany me for a DNA test and always fails to appear at the appointed time whenever she agrees to meet me,&quot; he said. He claims that his ex-girlfriend is already married and wonders why she decided to sue him after seven years. &quot;The DNA issue is paramount and the court will note that the child&#39;s name on the birth certificate differs from one in the suit,&quot; he said.
