Four rebel MPs have once again failed to honour summonses by the Orange Democratic Movement&rsquo;s (ODM) disciplinary committee.MPs Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro (Kilifi North), Mustafa Iddi (Kilifi South), James Rege (Karachuonyo) and Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East) did not appear before the committee yesterday to explain why they should not be expelled after announcing they had joined President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party (JP). The party wrote to 13 elected leaders who defected, asking them to show cause why they should not be de-registered.But only nine appeared before the disciplinary panel and vowed not to be shaken by the threat to expel them or subject them to by-elections.The ODM members vowed not to cede ground, even as the party firmed up its punishment process.&ldquo;The party should know that we also have our rights of expression. Not even their slightest decision will affect us. I was elected by the people not because of the party I chose, but because the people needed good leadership which I have,&rdquo; said Nakuru Town MP Samuel Arama shortly after facing the disciplinary panel.The MP termed calls by ODM that he quits for a re-lection as baseless and ill-advised.&ldquo;Only the electorate can guide our fate, not cheap party politics. We are not shaken as our aim is to impact the society through good leadership,&rdquo; he said.Lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, representing the politicians, told ODM&rsquo;s five-member disciplinary committee that the four leaders skipped the meeting because they are out of the country.Rigorous processHe said, however, that de-registering them will call for a rigorous process, which will take time to complete.&ldquo;Before the members are de-registered, the Political Parties Tribunal, the High Court and the Court of Appeal shall be involved before moving to a by-election,&rdquo; he said.Committee chairman Fred Athuok had warned that if the rebels do not honour the summonses, the disciplinary committee &ldquo;would be at liberty to make a decision on the matters at hand without any further reference to your clients.&rdquo;They MPs were however granted another chance to appear before the committee in the course of next week on a day yet to be set.Mr Aburi has remained defiant since the Orange party started the process of stripping rebel elected leaders of their membership.He has maintained that he will not appear before the committee, daring the party to expel him.Governors Ukur Yatani (Marsabit), Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Deputy Governor Joash Maangi (Kisii), MPs Steven Kariuki (Mathare), Cyprian Kubai (Igembe Central), Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town West), John Waluke (Sirisia) nominated MP Isaac Mwaura and Kwale Woman Representative Zainabu Chidzuga appeared before the committee.
