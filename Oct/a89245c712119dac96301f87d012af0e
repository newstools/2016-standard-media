With political heat intensifying in parties as members position themselves to win tickets, the women leaders - elected and aspirants - are now urging party leadership to ensure a level playground during nominations.While addressing journalists at a Kisumu hotel at the end of a two-day training workshop on leadership, the leaders decried favouritism that seen men being handed nomination certificates at the expense of women.The leaders - Siaya Women Representative aspirant Florence Aluodo, Kisumu MCA Caroline Ogot and her Kakamega counterpart Janet Oyondi, said more women will contest elective posts if they are assured of fair competition. &quot;We need the support from the party because we are working hard for ODM given that Siaya is a stronghold. We want to call on our party leader Raila Oding to support women in leadership. We want the party to come out strongly and support this cause,&quot; said Aluodo.Aluodo pointed out that there are issues which women are better placed to articulate like child and maternal health, persons with disability empowerment and reproductive health.She gave an example of Siaya County where women pay cash to access maternity services yet in other counties, it is free.
