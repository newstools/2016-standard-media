Men&nbsp;are the more honest sex, a new survey claims; Women are more likely to lie than men.Women are more likely to throw a &lsquo;sickie&rsquo; for work, cheat on a diet or make up an excuse to avoid a date, it added. But while that may paint an unflattering picture of females, it is not all bad, for women are also more likely to bend the truth so they do not hurt someone&rsquo;s feelings. The poll of more than 2,100 adults, by the appropriately named herbal tea brand Honest, found men are less likely to lie when it comes to work, health and romance. For example, 39 per cent of women have feigned illness to miss a day&rsquo;s work compared to 37 per cent of men.And one in three female dieters (33 per cent) have cheated on their weight loss regime without telling anyone compared to just 23 per cent of men.In the world of dating, 37 per cent of women but only 27 per cent of men have made up a fake excuse in order to get out of a date.But the research also suggests that maybe honesty is not always the best policy as six in ten women (60 per cent) but only 43 per cent of men would say they liked a gift when they didn&rsquo;t.Other lies uncovered by the poll show 35 per cent of both men and women have told someone they are on their way when they have not left the house yet.Nearly six in ten (58 per cent) of both sexes say they are always &lsquo;completely honest&rsquo; with their parents and 72 per cent are always honest with their partner.
