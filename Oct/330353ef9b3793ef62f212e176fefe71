Chaka town, a dusty roadside centre along the Nairobi-Nanyuki highway in Nyeri County has more than once been left mourning whenever there are terror attacks in Mandera. The town has had a large number of people killed in the Al Shabaab attacks. Chaka, which was initially headquarters of Kieni East Sub-county until early this year when the offices were moved to Narumoru, is home to hundreds of quarry workers, most of whom ply their trade in Mandera, where they claim they earn better wages than in local quarries. Generally, Chaka is a major supplier of building stones mined in quarries that surround the town. But the quarry workers accuse mine owners of paying them peanuts, while local stones are harder than those in Mandera.

Kirigo says many workers are still in various quarries in Mandera. Since 2014, more than 40 quarry workers from Chaka have been killed in terrorist attacks in Mandera. In the latest incident, seven of the 12 people killed when terrorists attacked Mandera town on Tuesday were from around Chaka. Joseph Muriuki and another one identified only as Mbogo were from Gatei and Maragima villages, five kilometres from Chaka town, while Amos Gachango and his nephew Simon Mwangi came from a village seven kilometres from the town. In July last year, 11 people from Chaka were killed in an Al Shabaab attack in Mandera. Those killed included Zachariah Ndung&rsquo;u, Charles Macharia, Samuel Kinyua, Charles Mathenge, Joseph Wahome and Peter Rurumo, all from Gathathi village. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 4 Next &raquo;
