On the western part of Narok South sub-county lies the Olomirani hills, which are a six-kilometre long awesome land mark.The hills got their name from Maa words Olo which means hills and Mirani which refers to miraa or khat. So Olomirani in Maa language means hills of miraa.Residents say the area got this name because years back, the hills had miraa growing wildly all over them. They were also used as a rendezvous place during cattle raids among the Kipsigis and Maasai communities. The Kipsigis would also turn to the place into a prayer ground for their God called Chepongolo &mdash; they believed that the hills height brought them nearer to God. They would also make sacrifices at this site in order to appease their ancestors during hardships such as drought and wars.Today, the slopes offer fertile ground for farming and locals grow maize, beans, wheat, vegetables, potatoes among others. Some of this produce is sold locally at the Mulot township open air market.The world renowned Mara River also passes through the hill&rsquo;s western side and provides a perfect spot for a quick dip especially during the hot seasons.
