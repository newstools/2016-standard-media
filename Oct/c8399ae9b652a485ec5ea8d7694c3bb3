A colleague alerted me to a recent study on air pollution in Nairobi and Africa.He asked that I find a way to inform policy makers, lawmakers and other people high in Government to this invisible silent killer.The report shows grim statistics. The first major attempt to calculate both the human and financial cost of the continent&rsquo;s pollution suggests dirty air could be killing 712,000 people a year prematurely, compared with approximately 542,000 from unsafe water, 275,000 from malnutrition and 391,000 from unsafe sanitation. Africa&rsquo;s air pollution could develop into a health and climate crisis reminiscent of those seen in China and India.Air pollution is caused by harmful particulates and gases, released in high quantities into the air. These pollutants cause disease and death to humans, damage to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and harm our ecosystems.Air pollution is caused by indoor and outdoor activities although the latter, which is largely a result of burning fossil fuels to produce electricity and to power vehicles, is responsible for most of the world&rsquo;s air pollution.Large and small scale industrial activities also cause air pollution by emitting substances into the air, which are harmful to human health and are the root cause of many of the respiratory diseases and cancers in humans.WHO officials compared the effects of indoor air pollution to the global burden caused by tobacco and unsafe sex.The four million deaths per year is more than Aids-related deaths, malaria and tuberculosis combined, according to WHO data.The study author notes: &ldquo;It is striking that air pollution costs in Africa are rising in spite of slow industrialisation, and even de-industrialisation in many countries.Should this latter trend successfully be reversed, the air pollution challenge would worsen faster, unless radically new approaches and technologies were put to use.
