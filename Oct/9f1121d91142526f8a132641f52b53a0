They found the three bodies lying in a pool of blood as Kiiru&#39;s dangled on a rope.&nbsp;A shocked Wachira described Kiiru as a polite man who lived well with his family. He said he had never witnessed conflicts between Kiiru and his wife since the time he employed him.&quot;I engaged him three weeks ago and I have not seen him misbehaving. I have not known him as a confrontational man. He was polite. I am so shocked,&quot; said Wachira.A neighbour, Mr Peter Chomba, said Kiiru and his family have not shown any signs of domestic conflicts since they moved to the village.Murang&#39;a County police commander Ms Naomi Ichami said they have already launched investigations into the matter.She appealed to residents with information regarding the family to volunteer it to the police to facilitate investigations.
