The Jubilee government is using taxpayers&#39; money to campaign for re-election, Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said.Speaking in Kisii County yesterday, Kalonzo said Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s government was siphoning public funds to fund campaign activities.He said the Government had failed to deliver its campaign promises and was now using huge resources to buy support from Kenyans. Addressing residents in Kisii town on the second day of his tour of Gusii region, Kalonzo dismissed Jubilee&#39;s frequent forays into the area, saying they were bound to fail in the 2017 elections.He said Kenyans must question the source of money that the Government was dishing out at fundraisers.&quot;This is a serious matter we are facing as a country. Deputy President William Ruto must explain the source of the money he is dishing out in harambees. We know his salary,&quot; said Kalonzo.&quot;If they know that they will win the next elections, then why spend all that money on non-development issues?&quot;Kalonzo hit out at Mr Ruto over his campaign to lure Opposition leaders to Jubilee Party, saying the country was well endowed with many young leaders who would take over the vacant positions.On Kisii politics, Kalonzo said the community must be allowed to exercise their democratic right. &quot;Why should a leader visit a single region every week?&quot; he asked.He said both Wiper and ODM had the same strength in Kisii, adding that the Opposition had changed tactics and was sure of winning the next polls.&quot;There is no hatred between ODM and Wiper, only that we want to exercise our democratic right and have the best leadership after the next general election,&quot; he said.He was accompanied by Senator Hassan Omar, his secretary general.
