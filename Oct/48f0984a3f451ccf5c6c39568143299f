CORD leader Raila Odinga yesterday accused the Government of planning to kick out Auditor General Edward Ouko.The Opposition chief warned of dire consequences if the State continued interfering with his (Mr Ouko&#39;s) work.Raila accused the Government of planning to bring up trumped-up charges against Mr Ouko to stop him from investigating sensitive fraud cases involving theft of billions of shillings from State coffers. The former Prime Minister said he has evidence that the Jubilee administration wants to allegedly intimidate Mr Ouko with the aim of covering massive corrupt dealings in the Government.He claimed Jubilee was scared that Mr Ouko has sensitive information on looting of resources.&quot;They want to stop him from travelling to the US to investigate the Eurobond rip-off,&quot; he claimed.Speaking in Nyacheki, Kisii County yesterday, Raila said Sh214 billion of the Eurobond money cannot be accounted for.He warned he will mobilise Kenyans to stage demonstrations across the country should the Government try anything against the Auditor General.During the Governance Summit at State House last week, President Uhuru Kenyatta turned the heat on Mr Ouko over his work, and wondered why he wanted to travel to the US to conduct investigations over the whereabouts of the Eurobond funds.Yesterday, Raila arrived in the country from London in the morning and headed straight to Nyacheki to campaign for&nbsp; ODM candidate Naftal Onkoba in the Nyacheki by-election slated for tomorrow.
