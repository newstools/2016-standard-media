NAIROBI: Hundreds of Kenyans are set to join a global walk to raise awareness about deadly cancers affecting women to enhance early detection and treatment.Participants are expected in Karura forest in Nairobi on Sunday morning for the Kenya Chapter of Globe-athon 2016. The walk will happen in 80 countries and 200 cities.The event, in its 4th year, has been organised by &ldquo;Women for Cancer Early Detection and Treatment&rdquo;, a local NGO led by women activists. The event will include 3.5 to 10 kilometres as well as family fun events. The walk seeks to enhance awareness, early screening and detection of deadly cancers such as cervical, ovarian and uterus among others.Common cancers affecting women in Kenya are those of the cervix, uterus, ovary, vagina and vulva.Cervical cancer is the second-most frequent cancer among Kenyan women and the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age.The estimated number of cervical cancer cases annually is nearly 3,000, while the death toll is about 1,600. By 2025, the number of new cervical cancer cases annually will reach 4,200, according to the Kenya Cancer Registry.Among this year&rsquo;s sponsors of the walk are Lancet Group of labs, which recently introduced new technologies allowing women to know if they have high-risk strains of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) that cause cervical cancer.Women are also able to collect samples from their vaginal canal for cervical cancer testing all by themselves thereby avoiding the common embarrassment when the procedure is done by others.&nbsp; Other sponsors of the walk are mobile service provider Orange among others.
