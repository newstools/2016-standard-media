In the affidavit filed on Tuesday and published on the channel&#39;s website, Zuma also admitted he was &quot;an implicated person&quot; in the report by the former Public Protector, a constitutionally mandated anti-graft watchdog. Zuma has denied granting undue influence to the Guptas and they have denied seeking it.
