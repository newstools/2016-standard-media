Distributors of veterinary medicines have warned of possible price increases of the vital commodities if an impending double regulation of the products is not resolved.Speaking under the umbrella of the Kenya Pharmaceutical Distributors Association, they expressed concerns about the recent gazettement of the Veterinary Medicines Directorate under&nbsp; the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry to regulate veterinary medicines. They said the move results in double regulation of the products.In a letter to the Health Ministry, KPDA Chairman Dr Kamamia Murichu&nbsp; said that currently, the products are being regulated by the&nbsp; Pharmacy and Poisons Board under the Ministry of Health and the law has not been changed to strip the body of that function. &ldquo;The effect of the gazettement&nbsp; is such that currently there are two bodies under different ministries performing the same function resulting&nbsp; in confusion in the industry if not double regulation,&rdquo; he wrote.He added: &ldquo; This will have the cascading effect of an increase in the cost of medicines for Kenyans. It may also increase presence of counterfeit and substandard medicines.&rdquo;The distributors called for a swift resolution of the matter to enable smooth running of the pharmaceutical sector and to ensure availability of cost-effective, quality and safe medicines for animals and humans.&ldquo;It is important to note that all medicines whether human or veterinary are manufactured by pharmaceutical companies and therefore it is not advisable to have these companies operate under different legislations or regulations for the same activities. We are ready to take this matter to court if it is not resolved,&rdquo; he said.Dr Murichu argued in the letter copied to the Attorney General and National Assembly Speaker, that it is illegal for the new directorate to take over the regulation of the veterinary medicines from the Pharmacy Board.He said the directorate was created by a subsidiary legislation and cannot supersede the Pharmacy and Poisons Act which grants the board the mandate over the products. He said&nbsp; subsidiary legislation cannot supersede primary legislation.&nbsp;Dr Murichu said the new directorate should restrict itself to regulation of veterinary practice and not veterinary medicines, saying the latter falls squarely in the docket of the Ministry of Health.&ldquo;The role of a veterinary professional is similar to that of a medical practitioner in that both professionals are trained to diagnose, provide prescriptions and administer treatments not regulate medicines,&rdquo; he said.Dr Murichu said veterinarians are not sufficiently trained to handle maters of regulating, preparing and dispensing&nbsp; of medicines&nbsp; as opposed to pharmacists.The distributors expressed concerns that some medicines like antibiotics that are for both human and animal use are included as being regulated by the veterinary medicines directorate.On its part, the Kenya Veterinary Association said the issues raised by KPDA were exhaustively discussed and adequately addressed prior to the gazettement of the VMD Regulations and approval by Parliament.&ldquo;Presentations were made to the CSs Agriculture and Health plus the AG and they remain convinced that VMD deserves to exist. Let&rsquo;s move on,&rdquo; said Dr Kenneth Wameyo, KVA Honorary Secretary.&nbsp;&nbsp;
