Former National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) Chairman Lee&nbsp;Kinyanjui has&nbsp;faulted&nbsp;Nakuru&nbsp;Governor Kinuthia Mbugua for using Mashujaa Day celebrations to attack his opponents.Mr&nbsp;Kinyanjui&nbsp;said instead of Mr Mbugua emulating the national event held in Machakos where President Uhuru Kenyatta embraced CORD Principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Watengul&rsquo;a, the Nakuru fete was reduced to political showmanship. While addressing the event at Afraha Stadium, the&nbsp;governor&nbsp;rubbished attempts to question performance of his government and delivery of service.Yesterday,&nbsp;Kinyanjui&nbsp;observed that while it is understandable why secrecy in public spending may be desirable, thegovernor&nbsp;should remember the position he holds is by trust and the people of Nakuru hold the sovereign power. &ldquo;Questioning public spending is a constitutional obligation that is bestowed upon the electorate and not a favour. We shall exercise it responsibly and hope that your office prepare appropriate answers and not emotional outbursts,&rdquo; he said.Kinyanjui&nbsp;has declared his intention to contest the gubernatorial seat in the 2017 elections.&ldquo;To ask for better roads and health care is not disloyal. My advice to the&nbsp;governor&nbsp;is this; we have a long way to go and you must distinguish between national duties and campaign platforms,&rdquo; the former Nakuru Town MP said.Kinyanjui&nbsp;has been critical of&nbsp;Governor&nbsp;Mbugua&rsquo;s performance, questioning his foreign trips and how they have benefited the county. He is also on record questioning Mbugua&rsquo;s development record, saying the county was nothing to show-off even after receiving over Sh44 billion from the exchequer in the past four years.&ldquo;Almost every imaginable country in the world has played host to hordes of delegations, in search of investors and bench marking best practice.It was expected that by now, we would be in custody of a couple of tangible investments,&rdquo; he said.
