PHOTO: CURTESYKenya&#39;s Oscar Award winner Lupita Nyong&#39;o&#39;s much-anticipated film premiered in Kampala at the weekend. The Disney World-produced movie has received positive reviews, with Lupita receiving acclaim for her role as Harriett, the mother of Phiona (Madina Nalwanga).Madina is debuting on the silver screen as a young 11-year-old talented chess player who wins the Uganda National Chess Challenge. The victory opens completely new horizons for girls born and bred in the sprawling slum of Katwe.The girls are often left homeless due to their challenging economic circumstances that do not allow regular income flow.Based on a true story, the film, Queen of Katwe, is directed by Mira Nair, the founder of Maisha Film Lab &ndash; a training programme for East Africans. This is where Lupita honed her acting skills before her big Hollywood breakthrough two years ago.&quot;I loved how she could be reserved and cheeky at the same time. We can all be inspired by her love, authenticity and fearless pursuit to do the best for her children while she had so much working against her. I&#39;m grateful that Mira Nair chose me for this role and for the precious time that Harriet spent with me,&quot; said Lupita of her role and character, Harriet Nakku, on her Facebook page a day before the Kampala launch.According to Lupita, who won Kenya&#39;s first-ever Oscar for her sterling portrayal of Patsy in Steve McQueen&#39;s 12 Years A Slave, her role in this new film helped her appreciate motherhood better.&quot;My mother has been a major inspiration in my life. I kept calling her to apologise for all the mistakes I made when I was child as I tried to fit into this role,&quot; she said.Queen of Katwe also stars Nigerian rising film star David Oyelowo who acts as Phiona&#39;s chess trainer in a state that depicts an economically-deprived Africa but with dedicated people who are working hard to make a difference.&nbsp;HOLLYWOOD AUDIENCEOne of the marked differences about this movie is that while a name as big as Disney has come to back it, there has been little effort to twist it to fit in the so-called Hollywood audience.The film has remained true to the realities of Africa, with mainly African actors taking both major and minor roles.&quot;Watching this movie leaves no doubt in the minds of the audience that there is a wealth of talent in this region,&quot; said Coalition for Reforms and Democracy leader Raila Odinga after watching the movie in Kampala on Saturday night.He observed that the film could be a powerful tool for people to tell their own stories in a big way, and that the stories could help them reflect on the disparities that exist in society.&quot;We need to catch up with our brothers and sisters in Nollywood and Bollywood with respect to volume given the fact that we have high quality talent in this region,&quot; said Raila.He promised that if he won next year&#39;s presidential elections, all major towns in the country would have theatre and cultural centres where raw talent could thrive.Today, only Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru boast performance theatres, with Nairobi&#39;s Kenya National Theatre having had a facelift recently.&quot;Queen of Katwe is a story that shows that given an opportunity, ingenious people from anywhere in the world can shine,&quot; remarked Kisumu Senator Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o after watching the film with Raila. The senator is Lupita&#39;s father.He praised the dedication and excellent acting portrayed by his daughter as well as other characters in the film.Queen of Katwe was first screened at the Toronto International Film Festival last month. On Saturday, it debuted across theatres worldwide.&quot;I honestly think the film is the best one I&#39;ve ever seen, with so many feelings and lessons. Amazing movie by Lupita,&quot; said Gerald Ford Otieno, a Kenyan living in the US who had just watched the film at an Imax theatre.
