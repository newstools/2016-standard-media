County Commissioner Maalim Mohammed has put exam cheats on notice. The commissioner said he had put in place a strong mechanism to counter the vice in the area. Mr Maalim said his office would officially devote time to the examinations in a bid to ensure that the county did not register any cases of cheating. With just two weeks to the start of the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) and the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examinations, the container where the papers will be stored has arrived in his office. &quot;We are aware that some people may try some tricks. But all the arrangements are in place,&quot; he said.
